Public disgust with Washington gridlock remains high, and with the 2016 presidential campaign beginning in earnest, broader voter interest \\u2014 especially among independents and Democrats \\u2014 could put recent GOP gains at risk in less than two years.\\n\\n\\u201cOn the things where we agree, the goal will be to make a law, not just put something on [Obama\\u2019s] desk,\\u201d incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in an interview, adding later: \\u201cI want to make it clear: Desire for a signature is not going to dictate everything that we do.\\u201d\\n\\nSecuring final passage of bills will require McConnell and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to compromise with Democrats while holding together their own ranks, which have clashed repeatedly over issues such as spending and immigration. Many GOP leaders hope that their differences can be set aside in favor of legislative wins.\\n\\nThe House and Senate formally reconvene Tuesday. New members will be sworn in and top leaders and committee chairmen formally installed on a day steeped in tradition and ceremony.\\n\\nBoehner and McConnell will be backed by larger GOP majorities: 246 Republicans in the House \\u2014 the party\\u2019s largest majority since just after World War II \\u2014 and 54 GOP senators, an impressive gain but short of the 60 votes required to overcome most procedural hurdles that Democrats will have at their disposal.\\n\\nIn the Senate, the rebranding effort will begin with energy policy.\\n\\nMcConnell plans to start his tenure as Senate majority leader with a \\u201cfull-throated\\u201d debate on national energy policy, ranging from a new oil pipeline to additional oil exploration. He has also promised consideration of liberal alternatives.\\n\\nMcConnell wants to use the controversial proposal to authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as the gen\\u00adesis for a free-wheeling Senate debate about the United States\\u2019 energy future, in which both sides will have the opportunity to offer and debate more expansive energy issues than the narrow pipeline proposal.\\n\\n\\u201cWe can treat this like a serious and significant energy debate,\\u201d McConnell said in an interview before Christmas in his Capitol office.\\n\\nObama has resisted GOP efforts to authorize the pipeline, but dozens of moderate congressional Democrats support the bill and a broader energy debate.\\n\\nOther Democrats are skeptical of McConnell\\u2019s plans.\\n\\n\\u201cThe $64,000 question as to whether the Congress can get anything done is which way the Republican leadership goes,\\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in an interview Saturday. \\u201cIf they let the tea party pull them to the right into the path of negativity and obstruction, we\\u2019ll get nothing done.\\u201d\\n\\nSen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), a lead author of the Keystone bill, said that Republicans plan to consider proposals allowing the export of liquefied natural gas; to give state governments greater power to oversee hydraulic fracturing; and to restrict the federal government\\u2019s role in the construction of cross-border gas pipelines.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we have an energy bill that doesn\\u2019t have a Democratic co-sponsor on it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBecause at the end of the day you\\u2019ve got to get at least 60 votes\\u201d to clear procedural hurdles.\\n\\nThe open process is part of McConnell\\u2019s effort to live up to his pledge to restore the Senate\\u2019s grand tradition of free and full debate, while also advancing conservative causes. A skilled practitioner in the use of the Senate\\u2019s arcane procedural rules to move or block legislation, McConnell has pledged to use those rules to score conservative wins. He has been coaching GOP senators that their most likely path to wins will come on the annual spending bills for the federal government \\u2014 which Republicans have routinely opposed on the grounds that they spend too much taxpayer money.\\n\\nOther party leaders echo those sentiments. \\u201cI think a majority [of Republicans] recognize that we have to govern responsibly,\\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who will become chairman of the Armed Services Committee. \\u201cWe have to show that we can be a productive party, and that, I think, will have a direct effect on whether we\\u2019re able to elect a Republican as president in 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut now, with control of the House and Senate, Republicans have more leeway to attach policy riders to spending bills that will restrict federal agencies in their oversight of environmental, labor and other regulations. These still may draw presidential vetoes, but McConnell believes that Republicans will have leverage to get some restrictions included, just as the mammoth spending measure approved last month included language sought by Wall Street firms making risky trades.\\n\\nIn the House, most of the early weeks will seem like a do-over of the past two years \\u2014 except that many of the bills passed will get swifter Senate consideration.\\n\\nUp first is a veterans employment bill that passed last year with bipartisan support, according to senior leadership aides. There is also a bill to loosen work requirements set by the Affordable Care Act and a similar bill to authorize the Keystone pipeline.\\n\\nThe second week of January will be devoted to a new spending plan for the Department of Homeland Security. The spending bill funds DHS only until the end of February, a move designed to give Republicans more time to craft a legislative response to Obama\\u2019s decision to change immigration policy through executive actions. But no specific proposals have emerged, the aides said.\\n\\nThen there are the investigations into alleged wrongdoing at agencies including the Internal Revenue Service, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n\\n\\u201cThere are issues that haven\\u2019t been resolved,\\u201d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\\n\\nHe is launching subcommittees to closely track Obama\\u2019s energy and environmental policies and created \\u201cadministrative rules,\\u201d a panel that will \\u201ctry to figure out what the administration is doing next with its rule-making authority. We\\u2019re going to jump on those as fast as we possibly can,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nBefore the work begins, Boehner is expected to face another leadership challenge. After he survived a close call two years ago, conservative blogs and radio shows are actively supporting another effort to unseat him.\\n\\nPresuming that the 434 currently seated House members show up to vote Tuesday and that all Democrats vote against him, at least 28 of the 246 Republicans also would need to vote against Boehner to deny him the gavel. (The 435th House seat is held by Rep. Michael G. Grimm (R-N.Y.), who plans to resign Monday after recently pleading guilty to tax evasion charges.)\\n\\nRep. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.), who opposed Boehner two years ago, said in a recent radio interview that he\\u2019ll do it again, adding that at least 16 to 18 Republican members might vote against the speaker. Among them is Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), who said Friday that he will vote against the speaker because the spending bill passed last month didn\\u2019t fully strip DHS of its funding.\\n\\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a Boehner ally, said in an interview that \\u201cI expect a few scattered \\u2018no\\u2019 votes. But because Boehner has been strengthened by the gains in the election, the speaker election should mostly be an uneventful coronation.\\u201d\\n\\nThe opening weeks of the new Congress are also expected to include the confirmation of Ashton Carter, Obama\\u2019s pick to lead the Pentagon, and Loretta Lynch to be the next attorney general. Concerns with Iran are also expected to be an early focus. The Obama administration persuaded Senate Democrats last year to hold off debating a bipartisan proposal authorizing stronger sanctions against the Iranian regime.\\n\\nBut Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said, \\u201cMy guess is fairly early on in some form or fashion the Senate\\u2019s going to want to weigh in on Iran.\\u201d\\n\\nCorker also plans to launch \\u201ca rigorous hearing process\\u201d on Obama\\u2019s decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. Republicans have threatened to block funding for a new embassy in Havana and confirmation of a new ambassador to Cuba. But Obama could veto spending bills that include such restrictions, sparking a showdown over whether the GOP is willing to shutter parts of the government over a new Cuba policy.\\n\\nIn 2016, Republicans will be defending at least 24 Senate seats and about a dozen first-term House members from swing districts around the country. Party leaders have a political imperative to govern and avoid short-term fights with Obama.\\n\\n\\u201cWe will see if there is an opportunity for a fourth quarter for President Obama that actually moves the country in the direction we\\u2019d like to go,\\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who also will be responsible for helping reelect GOP senators in 2016.\\n\\n\\u201cReagan did it a generation ago working with Democrats. Clinton did it almost two decades ago with welfare reform and deficit reduction,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo it can be done \\u2014 if the president is disposed to move in that direction.\\u201d\",\n          \"Reps. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Daniel Webster, R-Florida, are the three candidates vying for the post, and the winner becomes the favorite to become second in line to succeed the President of the United States.\\n\\nBut Thursday's vote inside the House GOP conference is just the first step. The candidate who gets the Republican party's internal nod still has to be approved by the full House of Representatives on October 29. And that's where things can get tricky.\\n\\nIf the Republican nominee can't garner 218 votes on the House floor, then Boehner will remain the speaker. And the potential for multiple rounds of votes on the House floor could open up the election to other candidates beyond the three that are in the race now. It would also prolong the deeply divisive and public process for House Republicans, who are hoping to chart a new path forward and prove they can make the dysfunctional Capitol work.\\n\\nThe three candidates will make their pitch to GOP colleagues at a \\\"candidate forum\\\" on Thursday morning in a conference room in the basement of the Capitol. Each gets three minutes to make a speech before answering questions from members. At noon, the 247 members of the House Republican conference gather in the ornate Ways and Means Committee room to vote. Under the House GOP conference rules, the three candidates are not allowed to make their own speeches. Instead each can designate one supporter to make a three-minute address nominating them for the post. Then up to two additional supporters can speak for another minute each on the candidate's behalf. To win the GOP nomination, a candidate needs a simple majority of all House Republicans -- or 125 votes. (That number could change if any House Republicans are absent or opts not to vote in the election.) Boehner plans to vote for McCarthy before heading to New York to tape an appearance on \\\"The Tonight Show,\\\" according to a spokesman. The delegate from American Samoa, Amata Radewagen, who doesn't get a vote on the House floor, does get to cast a vote for speaker inside the conference meeting. RELATED: John Boehner to appear on 'The Tonight Show' Three members serve as \\\"tally clerks\\\" and collect the ballots and count how many votes each candidate receives. Once all the ballots are counted, a representative of the conference will announce the results, along with the vote totals. If no candidate gets a majority of the conference on the first vote, a second ballot circulates with the names of the top two vote-getters, and a winner is announced after those ballots are counted. The new speaker can't take the gavel from Boehner until the full House of Representatives votes. Unlike the private contest on Thursday, the floor vote is covered live by C-SPAN's television cameras inside the House chamber. Each member of Congress is called on in alphabetical order to stand and announce their choice for speaker. The winner must win the votes of a majority -- 218, if everyone in the House is present -- in order to win. The vast majority of House Democrats are expected for to vote for former Speaker and current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. House Republican conference rules require that GOP members support their party's nominee on the floor, but many conservatives have ignored that rule in recent elections. That's where any drama will occur. If the GOP nominee fails to get a majority, the contest on the House floor could go to multiple ballots. Boehner will remain the speaker until a majority of the House votes to elect a new candidate. The last time it took more than one ballot to elect a speaker was in 1923 when it took nine ballots over the course of three days. And you don't need to be in the House to get the job. The Constitution does not require that the speaker be someone currently serving in Congress, but all who have been elected to the post have been House members. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Jeff Sessions received votes in the January 2015 election . And two years earlier, David Walker, the former head of the General Accounting Office, received one vote\",\n          \"Over the last six years, the Obama administration has been trying to address global warming\\u00a0with a flurry of rules aimed at reducing US carbon-dioxide emissions. First there were stricter fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks. More recently, the EPA\\u00a0proposed sweeping carbon regulations for coal-fired power plants (known as the \\\"Clean Power Plan\\\").\\n\\nThe overarching goal was to cut US greenhouse-gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. That, the administration believed, would help advance global climate talks.\\n\\nBut all of Obama's moves so far\\u00a0have been insufficient to get to that 17 percent cut by 2020. As recent analyses from the Rhodium Group and the Clean Air Task Force\\u00a0have argued, the US also needs to reduce methane emissions dramatically to get there:\\n\\nCarbon-dioxide is the biggest greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. But it's not the only one. There's also\\u00a0methane.\\u00a0The US burns a lot of methane \\u2014 known as \\\"natural gas\\\" \\u2014 for energy. But when methane leaks out of oil and gas wells or pipelines and into the atmosphere, it acts as a potent greenhouse gas. (The White House says it's 25 times as effective at trapping heat as carbon dioxide. Other scientists say 34 times.)\\n\\nIn 2012, the EPA estimated that methane accounted for roughly\\u00a08.7 percent of US greenhouse-gas emissions (though this may be an\\u00a0underestimate). But experts have warned that methane leaks could be poised to grow in the coming years.\\n\\nThanks to the\\u00a0fracking boom, US energy companies have been extracting more and more natural gas from shale formations. On one level, that's good news for climate change: utilities are now burning more natural gas for electricity instead of coal, which means lower carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants.\\n\\nThe problem is that all this new drilling increases the risk of methane leaking into the air \\u2014 and those leaks\\u00a0are undermining the climate benefits of the gas boom.\\n\\nIn theory, it should be doable to plug these methane emissions,\\u00a0which can come from leaky pipelines or faulty drilling operations. Many companies already\\u00a0use infrared cameras to detect leaks and plug them. And they have financial incentives to do so \\u2014 after all, these companies would rather capture that methane and sell it for money than just have it float off into the air.\\n\\nMany oil and gas companies are already taking steps to detect and plug leaks\\n\\nStill, the White House wants to make sure these leaks really get plugged. So, on Wednesday, it\\u00a0announced a goal of cutting methane emissions from oil and gas operations 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025.\\n\\nThis would be done through a combination of guidelines for voluntary actions by the industry and a hodgepodge of new regulations\\u00a0crafted by the EPA and other agencies. Some rules would focus on methane leaks from new oil and gas wells. Others would focus on pipelines used to transport the natural gas. The Interior Department is updating standards for drilling on public lands.\\n\\nThe White House noted that the oil and gas industry has already managed to cut methane emissions 16 percent since 1990 through voluntary measures. \\\"Nevertheless,\\\" it added, \\\"emissions from the oil and gas sector are projected to rise more than 25 percent by 2025 without additional steps to lower them.\\\"\\n\\nSome environmental groups said the White House's plan didn't go far enough. For example, the EPA is currently only working on rules to reduce emissions at new oil and gas wells \\u2014 and only much later will they work on rules for\\u00a0existing wells, which are by far the biggest source of emissions.\\n\\n\\\"While setting methane standards for the first time is an important step, failing to immediately regulate existing oil and gas equipment nationwide misses 90% of the methane pollution from the industry,\\\" Conrad Schneider of the Clean Air Task Force said in a statement.\\n\\nJayni Hein, policy director at the Institute for Policy Integrity at NYU School of Law, agreed: \\\"EPA's steps announced today would trim the sector's methane releases by about a third. We can and should go farther by regulating existing oil and natural gas sources.\\\"\\n\\nBy contrast, many oil and gas companies don't want new regulations at all \\u2014 they argue that the industry is already curbing methane leaks as is.\\u00a0\\\"Emissions will continue to fall as operators innovate and find new ways to capture and deliver more methane to consumers,\\\" said Jack Gerard, head of the American Petroleum Institute, in a statement. \\\"Existing EPA and state regulations are working. Another layer of burdensome requirements could actually slow down industry progress to reduce methane emissions.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, it's worth noting that there are other sources of methane besides oil and gas. In 2012,\\u00a0according to the EPA, roughly 30 percent of methane in the United States came from natural-gas and petroleum operations (though, again, that may be an undercount).\\n\\nObama is relying on voluntary measures for methane in agriculture\\n\\n-- By contrast,\\u00a036 percent of US.methane emissions came from agriculture. The beef and dairy industry is a major contributor here: when cows belch, they produce methane (known as \\\"enteric fermentation\\\"). Other sources include decomposing cow manure, as well as methane from rice cultivation.\\n\\n-- Another\\u00a018 percent came from landfills. When food and other trash decays in a landfill, the organisms that feed on that trash emit methane into the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe Obama administration\\u00a0has been working on steps to cut methane in these areas, too. Back in March, the EPA announced it would come up with standards to reduce methane from all future landfills. It will then solicit public comments on whether to regulate landfills that have already been built.\\n\\nAs for cow burps, however, the administration is relying on purely voluntary measures for now. In June 2014, the EPA unveiled a \\\"partnership\\\" with the dairy industry to speed up the adoption of methane digesters that turn cow dung into energy. The hope is to reduce methane emissions from the dairy sector 25 percent by 2020.\\n\\nFurther reading: Obama has promised to cut US emissions 17% by 2020. Is that still possible?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"REAL\",\n          \"FAKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Boehner (R-Ohio) to compromise with Democrats while holding together their own ranks, which have clashed repeatedly over issues such as spending and immigration. Many GOP leaders hope that their differences can be set aside in favor of legislative wins.\\n\\nThe House and Senate formally reconvene Tuesday. New members will be sworn in and top leaders and committee chairmen formally installed on a day steeped in tradition and ceremony.\\n\\nBoehner and McConnell will be backed by larger GOP majorities: 246 Republicans in the House \\u2014 the party\\u2019s largest majority since just after World War II \\u2014 and 54 GOP senators, an impressive gain but short of the 60 votes required to overcome most procedural hurdles that Democrats will have at their disposal.\\n\\nIn the Senate, the rebranding effort will begin with energy policy.\\n\\nMcConnell plans to start his tenure as Senate majority leader with a \\u201cfull-throated\\u201d debate on national energy policy, ranging from a new oil pipeline to additional oil exploration. He has also promised consideration of liberal alternatives.\\n\\nMcConnell wants to use the controversial proposal to authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as the gen\\u00adesis for a free-wheeling Senate debate about the United States\\u2019 energy future, in which both sides will have the opportunity to offer and debate more expansive energy issues than the narrow pipeline proposal.\\n\\n\\u201cWe can treat this like a serious and significant energy debate,\\u201d McConnell said in an interview before Christmas in his Capitol office.\\n\\nObama has resisted GOP efforts to authorize the pipeline, but dozens of moderate congressional Democrats support the bill and a broader energy debate.\\n\\nOther Democrats are skeptical of McConnell\\u2019s plans.\\n\\n\\u201cThe $64,000 question as to whether the Congress can get anything done is which way the Republican leadership goes,\\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in an interview Saturday. \\u201cIf they let the tea party pull them to the right into the path of negativity and obstruction, we\\u2019ll get nothing done.\\u201d\\n\\nSen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), a lead author of the Keystone bill, said that Republicans plan to consider proposals allowing the export of liquefied natural gas; to give state governments greater power to oversee hydraulic fracturing; and to restrict the federal government\\u2019s role in the construction of cross-border gas pipelines.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we have an energy bill that doesn\\u2019t have a Democratic co-sponsor on it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBecause at the end of the day you\\u2019ve got to get at least 60 votes\\u201d to clear procedural hurdles.\\n\\nThe open process is part of McConnell\\u2019s effort to live up to his pledge to restore the Senate\\u2019s grand tradition of free and full debate, while also advancing conservative causes. A skilled practitioner in the use of the Senate\\u2019s arcane procedural rules to move or block legislation, McConnell has pledged to use those rules to score conservative wins. He has been coaching GOP senators that their most likely path to wins will come on the annual spending bills for the federal government \\u2014 which Republicans have routinely opposed on the grounds that they spend too much taxpayer money.\\n\\nOther party leaders echo those sentiments. \\u201cI think a majority [of Republicans] recognize that we have to govern responsibly,\\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who will become chairman of the Armed Services Committee. \\u201cWe have to show that we can be a productive party, and that, I think, will have a direct effect on whether we\\u2019re able to elect a Republican as president in 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut now, with control of the House and Senate, Republicans have more leeway to attach policy riders to spending bills that will restrict federal agencies in their oversight of environmental, labor and other regulations. These still may draw presidential vetoes, but McConnell believes that Republicans will have leverage to get some restrictions included, just as the mammoth spending measure approved last month included language sought by Wall Street firms making risky trades.\\n\\nIn the House, most of the early weeks will seem like a do-over of the past two years \\u2014 except that many of the bills passed will get swifter Senate consideration.\\n\\nUp first is a veterans employment bill that passed last year with bipartisan support, according to senior leadership aides. There is also a bill to loosen work requirements set by the Affordable Care Act and a similar bill to authorize the Keystone pipeline.\\n\\nThe second week of January will be devoted to a new spending plan for the Department of Homeland Security. The spending bill funds DHS only until the end of February, a move designed to give Republicans more time to craft a legislative response to Obama\\u2019s decision to change immigration policy through executive actions. But no specific proposals have emerged, the aides said.\\n\\nThen there are the investigations into alleged wrongdoing at agencies including the Internal Revenue Service, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n\\n\\u201cThere are issues that haven\\u2019t been resolved,\\u201d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\\n\\nHe is launching subcommittees to closely track Obama\\u2019s energy and environmental policies and created \\u201cadministrative rules,\\u201d a panel that will \\u201ctry to figure out what the administration is doing next with its rule-making authority. We\\u2019re going to jump on those as fast as we possibly can,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nBefore the work begins, Boehner is expected to face another leadership challenge. After he survived a close call two years ago, conservative blogs and radio shows are actively supporting another effort to unseat him.\\n\\nPresuming that the 434 currently seated House members show up to vote Tuesday and that all Democrats vote against him, at least 28 of the 246 Republicans also would need to vote against Boehner to deny him the gavel. (The 435th House seat is held by Rep. Michael G. Grimm (R-N.Y.), who plans to resign Monday after recently pleading guilty to tax evasion charges.)\\n\\nRep. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.), who opposed Boehner two years ago, said in a recent radio interview that he\\u2019ll do it again, adding that at least 16 to 18 Republican members might vote against the speaker. Among them is Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), who said Friday that he will vote against the speaker because the spending bill passed last month didn\\u2019t fully strip DHS of its funding.\\n\\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a Boehner ally, said in an interview that \\u201cI expect a few scattered \\u2018no\\u2019 votes. But because Boehner has been strengthened by the gains in the election, the speaker election should mostly be an uneventful coronation.\\u201d\\n\\nThe opening weeks of the new Congress are also expected to include the confirmation of Ashton Carter, Obama\\u2019s pick to lead the Pentagon, and Loretta Lynch to be the next attorney general. Concerns with Iran are also expected to be an early focus. The Obama administration persuaded Senate Democrats last year to hold off debating a bipartisan proposal authorizing stronger sanctions against the Iranian regime.\\n\\nBut Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said, \\u201cMy guess is fairly early on in some form or fashion the Senate\\u2019s going to want to weigh in on Iran.\\u201d\\n\\nCorker also plans to launch \\u201ca rigorous hearing process\\u201d on Obama\\u2019s decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. Republicans have threatened to block funding for a new embassy in Havana and confirmation of a new ambassador to Cuba. But Obama could veto spending bills that include such restrictions, sparking a showdown over whether the GOP is willing to shutter parts of the government over a new Cuba policy.\\n\\nIn 2016, Republicans will be defending at least 24 Senate seats and about a dozen first-term House members from swing districts around the country. Party leaders have a political imperative to govern and avoid short-term fights with Obama.\\n\\n\\u201cWe will see if there is an opportunity for a fourth quarter for President Obama that actually moves the country in the direction we\\u2019d like to go,\\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who also will be responsible for helping reelect GOP senators in 2016.\\n\\n\\u201cReagan did it a generation ago working with Democrats. Clinton did it almost two decades ago with welfare reform and deficit reduction,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo it can be done \\u2014 if the president is disposed to move in that direction.\\u201d\",\n          \"Reps. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Daniel Webster, R-Florida, are the three candidates vying for the post, and the winner becomes the favorite to become second in line to succeed the President of the United States.\\n\\nBut Thursday's vote inside the House GOP conference is just the first step. The candidate who gets the Republican party's internal nod still has to be approved by the full House of Representatives on October 29. And that's where things can get tricky.\\n\\nIf the Republican nominee can't garner 218 votes on the House floor, then Boehner will remain the speaker. And the potential for multiple rounds of votes on the House floor could open up the election to other candidates beyond the three that are in the race now. It would also prolong the deeply divisive and public process for House Republicans, who are hoping to chart a new path forward and prove they can make the dysfunctional Capitol work.\\n\\nThe three candidates will make their pitch to GOP colleagues at a \\\"candidate forum\\\" on Thursday morning in a conference room in the basement of the Capitol. Each gets three minutes to make a speech before answering questions from members. At noon, the 247 members of the House Republican conference gather in the ornate Ways and Means Committee room to vote. Under the House GOP conference rules, the three candidates are not allowed to make their own speeches. Instead each can designate one supporter to make a three-minute address nominating them for the post. Then up to two additional supporters can speak for another minute each on the candidate's behalf. To win the GOP nomination, a candidate needs a simple majority of all House Republicans -- or 125 votes. (That number could change if any House Republicans are absent or opts not to vote in the election.) Boehner plans to vote for McCarthy before heading to New York to tape an appearance on \\\"The Tonight Show,\\\" according to a spokesman. The delegate from American Samoa, Amata Radewagen, who doesn't get a vote on the House floor, does get to cast a vote for speaker inside the conference meeting. RELATED: John Boehner to appear on 'The Tonight Show' Three members serve as \\\"tally clerks\\\" and collect the ballots and count how many votes each candidate receives. Once all the ballots are counted, a representative of the conference will announce the results, along with the vote totals. If no candidate gets a majority of the conference on the first vote, a second ballot circulates with the names of the top two vote-getters, and a winner is announced after those ballots are counted. The new speaker can't take the gavel from Boehner until the full House of Representatives votes. Unlike the private contest on Thursday, the floor vote is covered live by C-SPAN's television cameras inside the House chamber. Each member of Congress is called on in alphabetical order to stand and announce their choice for speaker. The winner must win the votes of a majority -- 218, if everyone in the House is present -- in order to win. The vast majority of House Democrats are expected for to vote for former Speaker and current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. House Republican conference rules require that GOP members support their party's nominee on the floor, but many conservatives have ignored that rule in recent elections. That's where any drama will occur. If the GOP nominee fails to get a majority, the contest on the House floor could go to multiple ballots. Boehner will remain the speaker until a majority of the House votes to elect a new candidate. The last time it took more than one ballot to elect a speaker was in 1923 when it took nine ballots over the course of three days. And you don't need to be in the House to get the job. The Constitution does not require that the speaker be someone currently serving in Congress, but all who have been elected to the post have been House members. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Jeff Sessions received votes in the January 2015 election . And two years earlier, David Walker, the former head of the General Accounting Office, received one vote\",\n          \"Over the last six years, the Obama administration has been trying to address global warming\\u00a0with a flurry of rules aimed at reducing US carbon-dioxide emissions. First there were stricter fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks. More recently, the EPA\\u00a0proposed sweeping carbon regulations for coal-fired power plants (known as the \\\"Clean Power Plan\\\").\\n\\nThe overarching goal was to cut US greenhouse-gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. That, the administration believed, would help advance global climate talks.\\n\\nBut all of Obama's moves so far\\u00a0have been insufficient to get to that 17 percent cut by 2020. As recent analyses from the Rhodium Group and the Clean Air Task Force\\u00a0have argued, the US also needs to reduce methane emissions dramatically to get there:\\n\\nCarbon-dioxide is the biggest greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. But it's not the only one. There's also\\u00a0methane.\\u00a0The US burns a lot of methane \\u2014 known as \\\"natural gas\\\" \\u2014 for energy. But when methane leaks out of oil and gas wells or pipelines and into the atmosphere, it acts as a potent greenhouse gas. (The White House says it's 25 times as effective at trapping heat as carbon dioxide. Other scientists say 34 times.)\\n\\nIn 2012, the EPA estimated that methane accounted for roughly\\u00a08.7 percent of US greenhouse-gas emissions (though this may be an\\u00a0underestimate). But experts have warned that methane leaks could be poised to grow in the coming years.\\n\\nThanks to the\\u00a0fracking boom, US energy companies have been extracting more and more natural gas from shale formations. On one level, that's good news for climate change: utilities are now burning more natural gas for electricity instead of coal, which means lower carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants.\\n\\nThe problem is that all this new drilling increases the risk of methane leaking into the air \\u2014 and those leaks\\u00a0are undermining the climate benefits of the gas boom.\\n\\nIn theory, it should be doable to plug these methane emissions,\\u00a0which can come from leaky pipelines or faulty drilling operations. Many companies already\\u00a0use infrared cameras to detect leaks and plug them. And they have financial incentives to do so \\u2014 after all, these companies would rather capture that methane and sell it for money than just have it float off into the air.\\n\\nMany oil and gas companies are already taking steps to detect and plug leaks\\n\\nStill, the White House wants to make sure these leaks really get plugged. So, on Wednesday, it\\u00a0announced a goal of cutting methane emissions from oil and gas operations 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025.\\n\\nThis would be done through a combination of guidelines for voluntary actions by the industry and a hodgepodge of new regulations\\u00a0crafted by the EPA and other agencies. Some rules would focus on methane leaks from new oil and gas wells. Others would focus on pipelines used to transport the natural gas. The Interior Department is updating standards for drilling on public lands.\\n\\nThe White House noted that the oil and gas industry has already managed to cut methane emissions 16 percent since 1990 through voluntary measures. \\\"Nevertheless,\\\" it added, \\\"emissions from the oil and gas sector are projected to rise more than 25 percent by 2025 without additional steps to lower them.\\\"\\n\\nSome environmental groups said the White House's plan didn't go far enough. For example, the EPA is currently only working on rules to reduce emissions at new oil and gas wells \\u2014 and only much later will they work on rules for\\u00a0existing wells, which are by far the biggest source of emissions.\\n\\n\\\"While setting methane standards for the first time is an important step, failing to immediately regulate existing oil and gas equipment nationwide misses 90% of the methane pollution from the industry,\\\" Conrad Schneider of the Clean Air Task Force said in a statement.\\n\\nJayni Hein, policy director at the Institute for Policy Integrity at NYU School of Law, agreed: \\\"EPA's steps announced today would trim the sector's methane releases by about a third. We can and should go farther by regulating existing oil and natural gas sources.\\\"\\n\\nBy contrast, many oil and gas companies don't want new regulations at all \\u2014 they argue that the industry is already curbing methane leaks as is.\\u00a0\\\"Emissions will continue to fall as operators innovate and find new ways to capture and deliver more methane to consumers,\\\" said Jack Gerard, head of the American Petroleum Institute, in a statement. \\\"Existing EPA and state regulations are working. Another layer of burdensome requirements could actually slow down industry progress to reduce methane emissions.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, it's worth noting that there are other sources of methane besides oil and gas. In 2012,\\u00a0according to the EPA, roughly 30 percent of methane in the United States came from natural-gas and petroleum operations (though, again, that may be an undercount).\\n\\nObama is relying on voluntary measures for methane in agriculture\\n\\n-- By contrast,\\u00a036 percent of US.methane emissions came from agriculture. The beef and dairy industry is a major contributor here: when cows belch, they produce methane (known as \\\"enteric fermentation\\\"). Other sources include decomposing cow manure, as well as methane from rice cultivation.\\n\\n-- Another\\u00a018 percent came from landfills. When food and other trash decays in a landfill, the organisms that feed on that trash emit methane into the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe Obama administration\\u00a0has been working on steps to cut methane in these areas, too. Back in March, the EPA announced it would come up with standards to reduce methane from all future landfills. It will then solicit public comments on whether to regulate landfills that have already been built.\\n\\nAs for cow burps, however, the administration is relying on purely voluntary measures for now. In June 2014, the EPA unveiled a \\\"partnership\\\" with the dairy industry to speed up the adoption of methane digesters that turn cow dung into energy. The hope is to reduce methane emissions from the dairy sector 25 percent by 2020.\\n\\nFurther reading: Obama has promised to cut US emissions 17% by 2020. Is that still possible?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"REAL\",\n          \"FAKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

As progressive journalist David Sirota suggested two years ago , reflecting on recent investigations showing that supermoneyed, right-wing capitalists such as the Koch brothers and Texas billionaire John Arnold had (along with more liberal software mogul Bill Gates) influenced PBS content through multimillion-dollar donations, the \\u201cP\\u201d in PBS often seems to more properly stand for \\u201cPlutocratic,\\u201d not \\u201cPublic.\\u201d \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\nNone of this should be surprising to anyone familiar with the distinctively big-business-dominated history of U.S. broadcast media . Because the United States fails to provide anything like adequate funding for public broadcasting, both PBS and National Public Radio (a regular vehicle for neoliberal business ideology) depend upon foundations, corporations and wealthy individuals to pay for much of their programming. Beneath their standard claims to have no interest in shaping public media content, these private funders have bottom-line agendas, meaning that their contributions come with strings attached\\u2014strings that undermine the integrity of the \\u201cindependent\\u201d journalism they bankroll. (For what it\\u2019s worth, between 1994 and 2014, the \\u201cNewsHour\\u201d was primarily owned by the for-profit firm Liberty Media . Liberty Media was run by the conservative and politically active billionaire John Malone, who had a majority stake in MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, the show\\u2019s producer.) \\nThe Pentagon Broadcasting System? \\nWhat might seem more surprising, perhaps, is the remarkable extent to which the \\u201cP\\u201d in PBS often seems to stand for \\u201cPentagon,\\u201d or perhaps \\u201cPresidential,\\u201d when it comes to foreign policy content. Whatever the global issue of the day or week, \\u201cNewsHour\\u201d anchors and their invited \\u201cexperts\\u201d can be counted on to report and reflect in accord with the doctrinal assumption that Washington always operates with the best of intentions. They almost uniformly treat the U.S. as a great, benevolent and indispensable force for freedom, democracy, security, peace and order in a dangerous world full of evil and deadly actors. \\nThe show\\u2019s invited commentators are drawn primarily from the nation\\u2019s imperial establishment. They are commonly current or retired insiders from within the Pentagon, the White House, the \\u201cintelligence community\\u201d and/or the nation\\u2019s elite network of foreign policy think tanks: the Council on Foreign Relations (the granddaddy of all U.S. ruling-class think tanks ), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Aspen Institute, the Atlantic Council, the Rand Corp. and the Hoover Institution, to name a handful. \\u201cNewsHour\\u201d anchors and guests generally agree that the United States\\u2019 officially designated enemies are malevolent bad guys who need to be contained, controlled and even attacked by the ultimate good guy, Uncle Sam. \\nNot surprisingly, the long and ongoing record of U.S. imperial arrogance and criminality (more on that below) is swept down George Orwell\\u2019s memory hole even as new entries are added to the ugly registry. When reported by the \\u201cNewsHour,\\u201d horrific crimes committed by the U.S. military are always treated as well-intended mistakes. Along with the rest of the mainstream U.S. media, the \\u201cNewsHour\\u201d \\u201cinsist[s] that Russia deliberately bombs hospitals, etc., whereas if we do it, it is, of course, an accident .\\u201d \\nThere\\u2019s some room for disagreement between and among the show\\u2019s invited experts\\u2014including the show\\u2019s semi-loopy foreign policy authority, Margaret Warner\\u2014about specific U.S. foreign policy tactics, strategies and actions. There\\u2019s no space for serious debate about the immorality, lawlessness or imperial nature of that policy. On the rare occasions \\u201cNewsHour\\u201d anchors seem to challenge guests from the White House or Pentagon on foreign policy matters, it is generally to ask why the U.S. isn\\u2019t going harder at the officially certified bad guys. \\nAmerica as Umpire, Not Empire \\nThe foreign policy coverage and commentary doesn\\u2019t get much better in the documentary division of PBS. A recent documentary (first aired nationally last week) shown by PBS bears the risible title \\u201cAmerican Umpire\\u201d\\u2014an obvious World Series season play on what the filmmakers see as the preposterous notion of an American empire. It is narrated by ex-Marine and former \\u201cNewsHour\\u201d host and producer Jim Lehrer. Developed by the right-wing Hoover Institution and \\u201ctargeted for PBS\\u201d (the organization\\u2019s own revealing phrase), \\u201cAmerican Umpire\\u201d takes the doctrinal \\u201cAmerican exceptionalist,\\u201d U.S.-good-and-civilized-rest-of-world-dangerous-and-bad narrative to absurd lengths. \\nIt provides extensive \\u201cexpert\\u201d commentary from such former imperial operatives as Madeline Albright (the onetime U.S. secretary of state who led the charge to criminally bomb Serbia and who went on CBS\\u2019 \\u201c60 Minutes\\u201d to say that the death of more than half a million Iraqi children killed by Washington-led \\u201ceconomic sanctions\\u201d was \\u201ca price worth paying\\u201d for the advance of U.S. foreign policy goals), Condoleezza Rice (George W. Bush\\u2019s neoconservative national security adviser before and during the arch-criminal U.S. invasion of Iraq), Gen. Jim \\u201cMad Dog\\u201d Mattis (an Iraq invasion commander and a former chief of the U.S. Central Command, who two years ago told a San Diego audience that \\u201cit\\u2019s fun to shoot people\\u201d), George Schultz (the Reagan-era secretary of state who called the Sandinista government in Nicaragua \\u201ca cancer in our own land mass\\u201d that must be \\u201ccut out\\u201d) and Karl Eikenberry (a retired Army lieutenant general who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan 10 years ago). \\nWith further commentary from a handful of mostly conservative academicians\\u2014above all the nationalist Texas A&M historian Elizabeth Cobbs ( author of a book on which the documentary is based), \\u201cAmerican Umpire\\u201d portrays 20th and 21st century U.S. foreign policy as nothing more than a noble effort to selflessly provide welcome and fair rules and discipline on the rest of a childish, dangerous and reckless planet (think \\u201cLord of the Flies\\u201d) that lacks the exceptional historical experience bequeathed to U.S. leaders by the nation\\u2019s far-seeing Founding Fathers. The only substantive criticism of U.S. foreign policy in \\u201cAmerican Umpire\\u201d is the complaint, voiced by numerous interview subjects, that America harms itself to the benefit of others (the Europeans above all) by taking upon its shoulders too much of the burden of benevolently policing the planet. We are just too good for our own good. \\nOur Real Task \\nThere is not space here to discuss in responsible detail the epic historical deletions and distortions this narrative imposes. The omissions are staggering. They range from the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos resisting U.S. imperial invasion and occupation at the last century\\u2019s outset to the restoration of de facto slavery in Haiti and the Dominican Republic after World War I; the unnecessary atom bombing of Hiroshima and, even worse, of Nagasaki (really the first shots of the Cold War ); the toppling of more than 50 governments by U.S. coups and invasions since the end of World War II; the liquidation of perhaps as many as 5 million Southeast Asians in the so-called Vietnam War between 1962 and 1975; the Cold War-era sponsorship of Third World fascism from Chile to South Africa and Indonesia; the attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro and numerous CIA-directed terror bombings in socialist Cuba; the near instigation of global thermonuclear war on at least three occasions; the development and sponsorship of Osama bin Laden and other radically arch-reactionary, jihadist Muslim, paramilitary forces to fight the Cold War against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; the \\u201cHighway of Death,\\u201d when U.S. warplanes engaged in an aerial traffic jam as they rushed to slaughter tens of thousands of surrendered Iraqi troops retreating from Iraq in 1991; the coordination and sponsorship of a mass-murderous civil war on peasants, workers and intellectuals (with a death toll well into the many hundreds of thousands) in Central America during the 1970s and 1980s; the disastrous U.S. invasion of Iraq (responsible for at least 1 million Iraqi deaths); the calamitous U.S. toppling of the Libyan Gadhafi regime; the calamitous destabilization of the Syrian regime; the U.S. funding and encouragement of civil war in central Africa; the enablement and protection of a vicious right-wing coup in Honduras in the spring and summer of 2009; the criminal U.S. global war of terror, replete with rampant \\u201ctargeted assassinations,\\u201d torture, illegal renditions, endless drone war and special-forces killing operations across the Muslim world and other places as well. \\n\\u201cAmerican Umpire\\u201d hides these horrific transgressions and the imperial calculations behind much of U.S. foreign policy past and present. As numerous key U.S. planning documents reveal over and over, the goal of that policy was to maintain and, if necessary, install governments that \\u201cfavor[ed] private investment of domestic and foreign capital, production for export, and the right to bring profits out of the country.\\u201d Given the United States\\u2019 remarkable possession of half the world\\u2019s capital after World War II, Washington elites had no doubt that U.S. investors and corporations would profit the most. Internally, the basic, selfish, national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed. As the \\u201cliberal\\u201d and \\u201cdovish\\u201d imperialist, top State Department planner and key Cold War architect George F. Kennan explained in Policy Planning Study 23, a critical 1948 document: \\u201cWe have about 50% of the world\\u2019s wealth, but only 6.3% of its population. \\u2026 In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity. \\u2026 To do so, we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming. ... The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.\\u201d \\nThe necessity of dispensing with \\u201chuman rights\\u201d and other \\u201csentimental\\u201d and \\u201cunreal objectives\\u201d was especially pressing in the \\u201cglobal south.\\u201d Washington assigned the vast periphery of the world economic (capitalist) system\\u2014Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the energy-rich and thus strategically hypersignificant Middle East\\u2014a less than flattering role. It was to \\u201cfulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market\\u201d ( actual State Department language ) for the great industrial (capitalist) nations (excluding \\u201csocialist\\u201d Russia and its satellites). It was to be exploited both for the benefit of U.S. corporations/investors and for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan as prosperous U.S. trading and investment partners organized on properly capitalist principles that were hostile to the Soviet bloc. \\n\\u201cDemocracy\\u201d was fine as a slogan and benevolent, idealistic-sounding mission statement when it came to marketing this core, underlying, ultra-imperialist U.S. policy at home and abroad. Because most people in the \\u201cThird World\\u201d had no interest in neocolonial subordination and subscribed to what U.S. intelligence officials considered the heretical \\u201cidea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people\\u201d (what post-World War II U.S. planners called \\u201ccommunism\\u201d), Washington\\u2019s real-life commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified, to say the least. \\u201cDemocracy\\u201d was suitable to the U.S. as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of U.S. investors/corporations and related U.S. geopolitical objectives. It had to be abandoned, undermined and/or crushed when it threatened those investors/corporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree. As President Richard Nixon\\u2019s coldblooded National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger explained in June 1970, three years before the U.S. sponsored a fascist coup that overthrew Chile\\u2019s democratically elected leftist President Salvador Allende, \\u201cI don\\u2019t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people.\\u201d \\nThe selfish imperial cynicism of U.S. foreign policy continues to this day, into the post-Cold War and post-9/11 era. As leading Dutch political scientists Bastiaann van Apeldoorn and Nana de Graaff write in their important new volume , \\u201cAmerican Grand Strategy and Corporate Elite Networks: The Open Door Since the End of the Cold War,\\u201d \\u201cFrom the end of the 19th nineteenth century onward, American grand strategy has pursued a liberal expansionism aimed at the creation of a global hegemony premised upon open, \\u201cfree\\u201d markets, to which global capital\\u2014and, above all, U.S. transnational capital\\u2014has full access. \\u2026 The global Open Door has continued to define the ends of the American grand strategy throughout the post-Cold War era.\\u201d Because\\u2014as during and before\\u2014the Cold War\\u2019s end, Washington\\u2019s commitment to \\u201cdemocracy\\u201d and \\u201chuman rights\\u201d is conditional and hypocritical: The noble principles are fine insofar as they serve the free-market hegemony of global and especially U.S. transnational capital. They are dispensed with, even as U.S. policymakers trumpet them, when they do not.\",\n          \"Jeb Bush Is Suddenly Attacking Trump. Here's Why That Matters\\n\\nJeb Bush isn't pulling punches anymore when it comes to Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe former Florida governor has delicately danced around the billionaire businessman in the 2016 presidential primary so far. But the gloves came off this week when Bush called out Trump as a closet Democrat. He was trying to stunt Trump's rise while attempting to recover his own political mojo.\\n\\n\\\"What Jeb is desperately trying to do is find his swagger right now,\\\" GOP strategist Ford O'Connell said. \\\"The knock against Jeb is that he's low voltage and not willing to fight. The best way to shake those perceptions it to engage against the person who is in the media on a 24/7 loop.\\\"\\n\\nIt's a change from Bush's approach to this point. He hasn't lobbed many direct attacks at Trump other than delicately condemning his criticism of Arizona Sen. John McCain's war service and his attacks against Fox News' Megyn Kelly.\\n\\nEven in this month's first debate, Bush swatted down a story that he had allegedly called Trump a \\\"buffoon\\\" and a \\\"clown,\\\" saying only that Trump's language had been \\\"divisive.\\\" Trump called Bush \\\"a true gentleman.\\\"\\n\\nThe detente ended this week. So far, most of the top-tier candidates have avoided directly attacking Trump, treating him with kid gloves so as not to anger the part of the GOP base to which Trump appeals.\\n\\nIn other words, the very voters they need when, they hope, Trump fades.\\n\\nIn split-screen New Hampshire town halls this week, Bush and Trump volleyed attacks on each other. Bush took his most pointed jabs at the current front-runner, underscoring Trump's past history as a Democrat and the liberal positions he used to hold.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Trump doesn't have a proven conservative record,\\\" Bush said, according to the Washington Post. \\\"He was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican. He has given more money to Democrats than he's given to Republicans.\\\"\\n\\nBush went on to attack Trump over his hard-line immigration proposal, arguing it was not just \\\"vitriolic\\\" but would have a massive price tag.\\n\\n\\\"Hundreds of billions of dollars of costs to implement his plans is not a conservative plan,\\\" Bush said. \\\"This is going to be my pitch: Let's support someone who you don't have to guess where he stands because he's consistent, because he's been governor, he's consistently had the views that he has.\\\"\\n\\nOver the next few days, Bush continued the hits on social media.\\n\\nBut Trump, never one to miss a moment to retaliate, didn't pull his punches, either. At his own town hall Wednesday, Trump blasted Bush as an unelectable \\\"low-energy person.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You know what's happening to Jeb's crowd just down the street? They're sleeping!\\\" Trump said to applause.\\n\\nSince then, Trump has also ramped up his attacks against Bush on Twitter.\\n\\nThe move to more hot rhetoric may have tripped Bush up, though. Consider his use of the phrase \\\"anchor babies.\\\" While immigration reform is something Bush is passionate about \\u2014 and has even written a book about \\u2014 he's often criticized within the GOP as too liberal on the issue. Instead, a more combative Bush appeared to use the loaded phrase for the first time.\\n\\nHe was left struggling to defend his use of it. It may have been a signal that the attack-dog crouch he's taking is still one that isn't completely comfortable to Bush, who earlier said he wanted to campaign \\\"joyfully.\\\"\\n\\nOther candidates have embraced hitting Trump. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul went after him forcefully in the debate, though his punch \\u2014 that Trump was hedging his bets to support Hillary Clinton if she wins the presidency \\u2014 didn't appear to land.\\n\\nOther candidates like Ohio Gov. John Kasich demurred. In the earlier GOP debate that night, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and businesswoman Carly Fiorina also jabbed at Trump.\\n\\nBush, though, needs to close the floodgates. He's dropped in national polls as Trump has risen. And, in New Hampshire, where Bush once led, Trump and even newcomer Kasich have seen surges.\\n\\nCullen, a former New Hampshire GOP chairman, said the change in tone and tactics was a smart move for Bush, one that could help him in the Granite State.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's good politics for Jeb,\\\" said Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire Republican Party chairman. \\\"There's 25 percent of the Republicans who are entertained by Donald Trump. But there's 60 percent of the party who say they won't vote for him under any circumstances. Those aren't Jeb Bush's people to begin with. He's trying to appeal to the other 60 percent by being the adult in the room and trying to govern.\\\"\\n\\nO'Connell agreed. He pointed out that even if this new approach is one that's uncomfortable for Bush, it's necessary.\\n\\n\\\"In a lot of elections, being the studious one would have worked,\\\" he said, \\\"but Trump has flipped the script.\\\"\",\n          \" Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy \\u0093Reform always provokes rage on the part of those who profit by the old order.\\u0094 Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Crisis of the Old Order\\nBy Paul Craig Roberts\\n Who are the anti-Trump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progressives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election? They look like, and are acting worse than, the \\u0093white trash\\u0094 that they are denouncing.\\nI think I know who they are. They are thugs for hire and are paid by the Oligarchy to delegitimize Trump\\u0092s presidency in the way that Washington and the German Marshall Fund paid students in Kiev to protest the democratically elected Ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup.\\nThe organization, change.org, which claims to be a progressive group, but might be a front, along with other progressive groups, for the Oligarchy, is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the Electoral Collage to annul the election by casting their votes for Hillary. Remember how upset progressives were when Trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged? Now progressives are doing what they damned Trump for saying he might do under certain conditions.\\nThe Western presstitutes used the protests in Kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup. The protest pay was good enough that non-Ukrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money. At the time I posted the amounts paid daily to protesters. Reports came in to me from Eastern and Western Europe from people who were not Ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were Ukrainians.\\nThe same thing is going on with the Trump protests. CNN reports that \\u0093for many Americans across the country, Donald Trump\\u0092s victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept. Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight.\\u0094 This is the exact reporting that the Oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got.\\nI hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in 25 cities were a spontaneous event. How did 25 independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election?\\nWhat is the point of the protests, and what interest is served by them? As the Romans always asked, \\u0093who benefits?\\u0094\\nThere is only one answer: The Oligarchy and only the Oligarchy benefits.\\nTrump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends to stop the giveaway of American jobs to foreigners. The jobs giveaway, sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as \\u0093free trade,\\u0094 is one of the main reasons for the 21st century worsening of the US income distribution. Money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to American manufacturing employees and college graduates has been re-routed to the pockets of the One Percent.\\nWhen US corporations move their production of goods and services sold to Americans offshore to Asian countries, such as China and India, their wage bill falls. The money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders. The ladders of upward mobility that had made America the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multi-billionaires.\\nTrump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends peaceful relations with Russia. In order to replace the profitable Soviet Threat, the Oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the \\u0093Russian Threat\\u0094 by demonizing Russia.\\nAccustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable Cold War, the military/security complex was angry when President Reagan brought the Cold War to an end. Before these leaches on American taxpayers could get the Cold War going again, the Soviet Union collapsed as a result of a right-wing coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.\\nThe military/security complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up \\u0093the war on terror\\u0094 to keep the money flowing to the One Percent. But as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of \\u0093the Muslim threat,\\u0094 even insouciant Americans knew that the Muslims did not have thousands of ICBMs carrying powerful thermo-nuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the United States in a few minutes. Neither did the Muslims have the Red Army capable of overrunning all of Europe in a couple of days. Indeed, the Muslims haven\\u0092t needed an army. Refugees from Washington\\u0092s wars enabled by Europeans are overrunning Europe.\\nThe excuse for the annual trillion dollar ($1,000 billion ) military/security budget was missing. So the Oligarchy created \\u0093the New Hitler\\u0094 in Russia. Hillary was the Oligarchy\\u0092s principle agent for heating up the new Cold War.\\nHillary is the tool, enriched by the Oligarchy, whose job as President was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the military/security complex. With Hillary in the White House, the looting of the American taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the One Percent could go forward unimpeded. But if Trump resolves \\u0093the Russian threat,\\u0094 the Oligarchy takes an income hit.\\nHillary\\u0092s job as President was also to privatize Social Security in order that her Wall Street benefactors can rip off Americans the way that Americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under Obamacare.\\nThose Americans who do not pay attention think, mistakenly, that the FBI cleared Hillary of violating National Security protocols with her email practices. The FBI said that Hillary did violate National Security, but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance. She got off from indictment, because the FBI concluded that she did not intentionally violate National Security protocols. The investigation of the Clinton Foundation continues.\\nIn other words, in order to protect Hillary the FBI fell back on the ancient common law rule that \\u0093there can be no crime without intent.\\u0094 (See PCR and Lawrence Stratton, The Tyranny of Good Intentions .)\\nOne would think that protesters, if they were legitimate, would be celebrating Trump\\u0092s victory. He, unlike Hillary, promises to reduce tensions with powerful Russia, and we hope also with China. Unlike Hillary, Trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of 25 cities against him.\\nIn other words, the protests against the American people for electing Trump as their president are pointless. The protests are happening for one reason only. The Oligarchy intends to delegitimize the Trump Presidency. Once President Trump is delegitimized, it will be easier for the Oligarchy to assassinate him. Unless the Oligarchy can appoint and control Trump\\u0092s government, Trump is a prime candidate for assassination.\\nThe protests against Trump are suspicious for another reason. Unlike Hillary, Obama, and George W. Bush, Donald Trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries, sending millions of refugees from the Oligarchy\\u0092s wars to overrun Europe.\\nTrump earned his fortune, and if by hook or crook, not by selling US government influence to foreign agents as Bill and Hillary did.\\nSo what are the protesters protesting?\\nThere is no answer except that they are hired to protest. Just as the Maidan protesters in Kiev were hired to protest by US and German financed NGOs.\\nThe protests in Kiev were equally pointless, because presidential elections were only months away. If Ukrainians really believed that their president was conspiring with Russia to keep Ukraine from becoming a Western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs, the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand. The only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup. The US did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new Ukrainian government as Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the Internet.\\nThe Maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible. The protests were without any doubt arranged by Washington through Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, a neoconservative brought into the State Department by Hillary Clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with Russia.\\nTrump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the Oligarchy that he is thought to be.\\nTrump won the presidency, but the Oligarchy is still in power, which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve. Symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between President Trump and the oligarchs.\\nKarl Marx learned from historical experience, and Lenin, Stalin, and Pol Pot learned from Karl Marx, that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them. We have proof of this throughout South America. Every revolution by the indigenous people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class, and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington.\\nWashington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of Honduras on a number of occasions. Recently, Washington helped elites evict the female presidents of Argentina and Brazil. The presidents of Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive. Washington is determined to get its hands on Julian Assange. To achieve this Washington intends to overthrow the Ecuadoran government that, in defiance of Washington, gave Julian Assange political asylum.\\nHugo Chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the Spanish ruling class in Venezuela when the ruling class participated in a CIA coup against Chavez. But before the CIA could kill Chavez, the people and the military forced his release. Instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him, Chavez let them go.\\nAccording to Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary. To rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution.\\nLatin American has proved itself unable to learn this lesson: Revolutions cannot be conciliatory.\\nTrump is a dealmaker. The Oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change.\\nTrump is not perfect. He might fail on his own. But we should back him on the two most important elements in his program: to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers, and to halt Washington\\u0092s policy of permitting globalism to destroy Americans\\u0092 economic prospects.\\nIf tensions between nuclear powers worsen, we won\\u0092t be here to worry about other problems. The combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare. That Trump understands this is reason to support him.\\nNote: Some believe that Trump is a ruse conducted by the Oligarchy. However, as Hillary is the bought-and-paid-for representative of the Oligarchy, such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary. It is preferable for the Oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around. Another sellout increases the anger of the people. If Hillary had won, the Oligarchy would have had the voters\\u0092 mandate for their platform.\\nDr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following.

And if there's anything top FBI officials now, it's crime families. Certainly this is probably the first serious level of experience that Hillary can claim in any field. \\n\\u201cThe Clintons, that\\u2019s a crime family, basically,\\u201d former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.\\u201d \\n\\u201cKallstrom, best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late '90s, said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a \\u201cpathological liar.\\u201d \\nHe also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clinton\\u2019s private server. \\n\\u201cThe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I\\u2019m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.\\u201d \\nKallstrom also said that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the FBI\\u2019s leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation, not the rest of the bureau. \\n\\u201cThe agents are furious with what\\u2019s going on, I know that for a fact,\\u201d he said. \\nBut according to the media, the FBI investigating Hillary is the real crime.\",\n          \"First ever Hindu was elected to the US House of Representatives. She will take the oath of office over the Bhagavad Gita. \\n\\nDuring election, Hawaii elected Japan-born Mazie Hirono to be the first ever Asian-American woman elected to the Senate. Hawaii also elected Democrat Tulsi Gabbard as the first ever practicing Hindu to the US House of Representatives. Because of this, Fox News have declare Hawaii a \\u201cdisaster zone\\u201d. \\n\\nGabbard is the daughter of two conservative Hawaii politicians. She first ran, and was elected into office at the age of 21. After her first term, she served on a 12 month tour of duty with Hawaii\\u2019s National Guard, and then became the first woman in history of the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy to be designated a \\u201cdistinguished honor graduate\\u201d. \\n\\nShe was then deployed to Baghdad as a medical operations specialist in 2004, and she was deployed to Kuwait in 2008. \\n\\nHistory has proven that not everyone is comfortable with a Hindu elect. When Hindu statesman Rajan Zed was asked by the Senate to open with a prayer in 2007, the American Family Association called the prayer \\u201cgross idolatry\\u201d and urged people to protest. Three protesters interrupted the prayer with shouts from the gallery. \\n\\nWhen she is sworn this January, Gabbard will take her oath of office over the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred text for Hinduism or Sanatana Dharma. \\n\\nGabbard hopes to assist the US in fostering a better relationship with India, the world\\u2019s largest democracy with a growing economic and nuclear power. She also hopes to work on veteran\\u2019s affairs, and environmental issues. \\n\\nOther non-Christian people in Congress include Minnesota\\u2019s Keith Ellison, who took his oath of office over the Qu-ran. \\n\\nAriana Marisol is a contributing staff writer for REALfarmacy.com.

              "A series of legal setbacks have halted the government’s intensive preparations to move forward with President Obama’s executive actions shielding millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, even as community organizations continue a rapid push to get ready for the programs, according to U.S. officials and immigrant advocacy groups.\\n\\nSince a federal judge first blocked the new programs in February, the Department of Homeland Security has suspended plans to hire up to 3,100 new employees, most of whom would be housed in an 11-story building the government has leased for $7.8 million a year in Arlington, Va. That building, in the Crystal City area, is now sitting mostly unused, DHS employees say.\\n\\nYet inside and outside the Beltway, community groups are mobilizing, educating immigrants and training volunteers to help them apply for relief, even though it remains unclear whether the program will ever begin. Most recently, a foundation headed by billionaire George Soros, undaunted by the court rulings, pledged at least $8 million to that effort.\\n\\n“We’re full speed ahead,” said Josh Hoyt, executive director of the Chicago-based National Partnership for New Americans, a coalition of pro-immigrant groups that have held more than 700 information sessions on the new programs and trained more than 2,000 volunteers to aid immigrants in applying for them.\\n\\nObama announced in November that up to 5 million illegal immigrants would be eligible to be shielded from deportation — including undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents — as long as they met certain criteria. One of the signature initiatives of his presidency, the plan also expands a 2012 program that has deferred the deportations of more than 600,000 immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children and has granted most of them work permits.\\n\\nBut after Texas and 25 other states sued the administration, calling the moves unconstitutional, a federal judge in Texas in February put them on hold until the case is resolved. A federal appeals court recently upheld that injunction, with legal observers now saying the court fight could last until late in Obama’s term. The 2012 program remains unaffected.\\n\\nThe legal battle highlights the explosive nature of the immigration debate, which has emerged as an early issue in the 2016 presidential race even as immigration legislation remains stalled in Congress. The fate of Obama’s executive action benefiting immigrant parents, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, will resonate into the next administration. Most Republican presidential candidates have pledged to overturn Obama’s immigration actions, while leading Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has strongly endorsed them.\\n\\nAs soon as Obama took his actions on Nov. 20, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services “immediately began efforts to implement those initiatives,’’ said Marsha Catron, a DHS spokeswoman. The next day, the agency leased a 280,000-square-foot building on Crystal Drive in Crystal City to house DAPA employees, according to DHS documents sent to Congress.\\n\\nThe building came fully furnished but required about $26 million in start-up costs, including $2.7 million for workstation and desktop equipment, documents show. Those costs were to be funded with fees collected from immigrants who had applied for other government programs, and DHS says DAPA would have no impact on any existing programs.\\n\\nCitizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, is central to managing the nation’s immigration system and processes more than 6 million citizenship and other applications and petitions each year.\\n\\nThe plan also called for 1,000 employees, mostly new hires, to start up DAPA in Crystal City and 400 staffers at other service centers nationwide to process applications for the expanded 2012 program for immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children. That program is known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.\\n\\nOver time, however, Citizenship and Immigration Services projected that a total of 3,100 new employees might be needed for the two programs, which were expected to cost up to $484 million per year and be paid for by the $465 application fees required for each applicant.\\n\\nBy mid-February, DHS was days away from beginning to accept applications for the expanded DACA program, with the first DAPA applications to follow in May.\\n\\nBut on Feb. 16, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Texas issued his ruling temporarily blocking both. Citizenship and Immigration Services “immediately took steps to ensure the agency ceased its preparations,’’ said Catron, who added that DHS is “disappointed” by that decision as well as the May 26 one by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upholding it.\\n\\nSince then, “everything is on hold,” said Kenneth Palinkas, president of National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council 119, which represents about 12,000 Citizenship and Immigration Services employees. Current employees who had been offered jobs in Crystal City have had the offers put on hold or rescinded, he said.\\n\\nAs for the Crystal City building, only the first floor is being used to train employees, about 30 at a time, on various aspects of immigration law, said Palinkas, who recently toured the facility.\\n\\nFederal contractors, some of whom were also slated to work in Crystal City, have also been affected. DHS has canceled a request for proposals for a new mail and file room operations center to be staffed by about 400 contractors, documents said.\\n\\n“It’s kind of come to a screeching halt,’’ said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which helps immigrants with legal and other issues. She said the Obama administration “is being very cautious. . . . They feel that injunction was very clear, that they’re not able to do anything.”\\n\\nBut immigrant advocacy groups feel differently, she said, because activists are confident that the administration will eventually prevail in the courts. “There is a sense of being undeterred, that we are going to continue planning,” she said. “We need to make sure that the infrastructure is in place and ready to go.’’\\n\\nAcross the nation, immigration advocacy organizations and other community groups are training people who will act as “navigators” — helping immigrants determine whether they are eligible for DAPA , locate key documents such as school transcripts and fill out the application. Activists describe the training as similar to that for another key Obama initiative, the Affordable Care Act, which also used navigators to help people enroll for health insurance.\\n\\n“The reality is you can’t turn on a switch in people’s lives and all of the sudden 5 million people pour into the gates of DHS and move into the application process,’’ said Ken Zimmerman, director of U.S. programs for the Open Society Foundations, of which Soros is founder and chairman.\\n\\nZimmerman said the $8 million the organization is making available will go to a variety of community groups and will fund things such as new computer software to help them process applications. He said the foundations may donate more.\\n\\nIn the Washington area, CASA — a Maryland-based immigrant advocacy group — is continuing the DAPA informational sessions it has been holding in Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Delaware since Obama’s announcement in November.\\n\\nAt first, “hundreds and hundreds upon hundreds” of people showed up, said George Escobar, CASA’s senior director of human services. Since then, he said, “obviously interest has waned a little” amid frustration over the legal setbacks.\\n\\n“Our job is to keep people motivated,” added Escobar, who believes it is “highly likely” that DAPA will survive the court challenge. “We will continue to prepare for it,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
              "As he tries to charm Republicans still skeptical of his presidential candidacy, Donald Trump has a challenge: On several key issues, he sounds an awful lot like a Democrat.\\n\\nAnd on some points of policy, such as trade and national defense, the billionaire businessman could even find himself running to the left of Hillary Clinton, his likely Democratic rival in the general election.\\n\\nTrump is a classic Republican in many ways. He rails against environmental and corporate regulations, proposes dramatically lower tax rates and holds firm on opposing abortion rights. But the presumptive GOP nominee doesn't fit neatly into a traditional ideological box.\\n\\n\"I think I'm running on common sense,\" he said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"I think I'm running on what's right. I don't think in terms of labels.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Trump's clearest break with Republican orthodoxy is on trade, which the party's 2012 platform said was \"crucial for our economy\" and a path to \"more American jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living.\"\\n\\nTrump says his views on trade are \"not really different\" from the rest of his party's, yet he pledges to rip up existing deals negotiated by \"stupid leaders\" who failed to put American workers first. He regularly slams the North American Free Trade Agreement involving the U.S, Mexico and Canada, and opposes a pending Asia-Pacific pact, positions shared by Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders.\\n\\n\"The problem is the ideologues, the very conservative group, would say everything has to be totally free trade,\" Trump said. \"But you can't have free trade if the deals are going to be bad. And that's what we have.\"\\n\\nTrump long has maintained that he has no plans to scale back Social Security benefits or raise its qualifying retirement age. The position puts him in line with Clinton. She has said she would \"defend and expand\" Social Security, has ruled out a higher retirement age and opposes reductions in cost-of-living adjustments or other benefits.\\n\\n\"There is tremendous waste, fraud and abuse, but I'm leaving it the way it is,\" Trump recently told Fox Business Network.\\n\\nIt's a stance at odds with the country's top-ranked elected Republican, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who has advocated fundamental changes to Social Security and other entitlement programs. But it's also one that Trump argues keeps him in line with the wishes of most voters.\\n\\n\"Remember the wheelchair being pushed over the cliff when you had Ryan chosen as your vice president?\" Trump told South Carolina voters this year, referring to then-vice presidential candidate Ryan's budget plan. \"That was the end of that campaign.\" Ryan was Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012.\\n\\nComplicating the efforts to define Trump is his penchant for offering contradictory ideas about policy. He also has taken recently to saying that all of his plans are merely suggestions, open to later negotiation.\\n\\nTrump's tax plan, for instance, released last fall, called for lowering the rate paid by the wealthiest people in the United States from 39.6 percent to 25 percent and slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.\\n\\nTrump described it as a massive boon for the middle class. Outside experts concluded it disproportionately benefited the rich and would balloon the federal deficit.\\n\\nClose to clinching the nomination, Trump now appears to be pulling away from his own proposal. While he still wants to lower taxes for the wealthy and businesses, he now says his plan was just a starting point for discussions and he would like to see the middle class benefit more from whatever changes he seeks in tax law.\\n\\n\"We have to go to Congress, we have to go to the Senate, we have to go to our congressmen and women and we have to negotiate a deal,\" Trump said recently. \"So it really is a proposal, but it's a very steep proposal.\"\\n\\nTrump has a similar take on the minimum wage. Trump said at a GOP primary debate that wages are too high, and later made clear that he does not support a federal minimum wage. Yet when speaking about the issue, he says he recognizes the difficulty of surviving on the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.\\n\\n\"I am open to doing something with it,\" he told CNN this month.\\n\\nOn foreign policy, Trump already appears working to paint Clinton as a national security hawk who would too easily the lead the country into conflict.\\n\\n\"On foreign policy, Hillary is trigger happy,\" Trump said at a recent rally, He listed the countries where the U.S. had intervened militarily during her tenure as secretary of state and pointed to her vote to authorize the Iraq war while she was in the Senate.\\n\\nTrump's own \"America First\" approach appears to lean more toward isolationism. One of his foreign policy advisers, Walid Phares, recently described it as a \"third way.\"\\n\\n\"This doesn't fit any of the boxes,\" Phares said.\\n\\nClinton has advocated using \"smart power,\" a combination of diplomatic, legal, economic, political and cultural tools to expand American influence. She believes the U.S. has a unique ability to rally the world to defeat international threats.\\n\\nShe argues the country must be an active participant on the world stage, particularly as part of international alliances such as NATO. Trump has criticized the military alliance, questioning a structure that sees the U.S. pay for most of its costs.\\n\\n\"No, I think I'm much tougher than her on foreign — and I think we won't have to use it,\" Trump recently told Fox News when asked whether he might come to Clinton's left on some foreign policy issues. \"You know, I appear that I might — maybe to the left.

              "BROOKLYN, N.Y.—With a critical primary contest just days away, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders met on a Brooklyn stage Thursday night for what could be their final debate.\\n\\nAnd, unlike their first debate many months ago and others in between, the candidates did not pull a single punch, underscoring the high stakes for both of them: Clinton, wanting to wrap up the primary and focus her energy and resources on the general election; Sanders, hoping to prolong the race through the summer.\\n\\n\"If you’re both screaming at each other, the viewers won’t be able to hear either of you,\" CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer said at one point during the debate at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\\n\\nGiven both Clinton and Sanders’ intimate familiarity with the state, each  tried to hammer home policy differences through a New York lens, from issues such as Wall Street influence to gun control to foreign policy as it relates to Israel. But the arguments put forth echoed messages each has been pushing for some time, and aren’t likely to influence the outcome of Tuesday’s contest in New York.\\n\\nSanders has stepped back from questioning Clinton’s qualifications, but he did re-engage on his concerns about her judgment.\\n\\n\"Does Secretary Clinton have the intelligence, the experience to be president? Of course she does, but I do question her judgment,” he said. “I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country; voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street.”\\n\\nFor her part, Clinton questioned Sanders’ depth of knowledge, invoking a New York Daily News editorial board meeting in which the Vermont senator struggled to answer questions on breaking up big banks and on foreign policy. “I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief,” she said.\\n\\nClinton also reminded the audience of her connections to New York and to President Obama, whose legacy she says she would like to build upon. “The people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator,” she said. “And President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of state for the United States.”\\n\\nClinton’s embrace of Obama throughout this primary process figures to help mobilize key coalitions that propelled his presidential victories, especially in the diverse and voter-rich New York City. She has argued that she has not only more pledged delegates than Sanders, but also more votes—even more than Obama had in building his lead over her in 2008, she noted. She is also hoping to calm concerns among Democrats that a prolonged primary would hurt the party in the general election, noting that the race between herself and Obama eight years ago went on longer than this one has and the party was still able to unite and win that November.\\n\\n“Where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic,” she said, but “I’m not taking anything for granted, or any voter or any place.”\\n\\nFor his part, Sanders continued to mobilize his base in a way that underscored Clinton’s potential vulnerabilities in trying to unite the party down the road.\\n\\n“Establishment politicians are never going to address the crises we face,” he said of his rival. “You can’t take money … and expect the American people to expect you’re going to stand up to these special interests.”\\n\\nThe race has become much more heated in recent weeks, a notable shift in a party primary that had been largely, and unconventionally, cordial, especially in contrast to the Republican contest. Sanders has escalated his attacks in an effort to keep pace, raising questions about Clinton’s judgment, harping on her vote for the Iraq War and her acceptance of large sums of money for speeches given to Goldman Sachs and Verizon, among others.\\n\\nSanders again called on Clinton to release the transcripts of her paid speeches. She deflected, even when pressed again by the moderators, by pushing Sanders to release his tax returns.\\n\\nFor her part, Clinton has hit Sanders on the issue of gun control, invoking the families of Sandy Hook Elementary School victims, and criticizing her opponent over legal loopholes that give immunity from lawsuits to gun manufacturers. “We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street,” Clinton said. “But what about the greed and recklessness of the gun lobby.”\\n\\nAsked about the daughter of the Sandy Hook principal calling on Sanders to apologize for his stance on the issue, the Democratic socialist declined, but said he supported the right of the families to sue the manufacturer of the AR-15 used to kill children in the massacre. The issue of gun control figures to be a mobilizing factor among Democrats, particularly in New York, a state that both candidates claim as home turf: Clinton is a current resident who represented New York for eight years in the U.S. Senate, and Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn.\\n\\nBut each see the significance of the state differently. Clinton hopes an overwhelming win here will halt Sanders’ momentum and bring the primary closer to a conclusion, allowing her to shift focus to the Republican opponents. For Sanders, who has won the past seven contests but still lags behind in the delegate count, a win would keep alive some hope of clinching the nomination and deliver a blow to the Clinton campaign’s morale.\\n\\nDefeating Clinton in her adopted home state appears unlikely at this point for Sanders. The former secretary of state leads by nearly 14 points there, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. One recent NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll shows Clinton has expanded her lead over the past few days. The two candidates were tied in upstate New York, according to the poll. Sanders does best among younger voters (under age 45) and those who consider themselves very liberal.\\n\\nNew York’s closed primary system will also pose a challenge for Sanders, as independent voters are a key part of his base. The campaign has worked to persuade such voters to register as Democrats in order to vote for him. After having twice won New York statewide, Clinton is no stranger to campaigning in the state. She has won endorsements from unions and the New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who ran her Senate campaign, as well as African-American leaders. Clinton’s message of building upon the legacy of Obama figures to serve her well there.\\n\\nBut Sanders was able to draw 27,000 people for a rally in Greenwich Village. The image of a packed Washington Square Park, near the campus of NYU, captured the energy his campaign has generated, particularly among young people. The event also underscored a challenge Clinton could have if she becomes the nominee in galvanizing Sanders’ supporters for a victory in the general election.\\n\\nWhile Clinton continues to pile up delegates even as Sanders wins states, given the proportional allocation involved, his continued presence and influence have prolonged the race. He has also continued to show overwhelming fundraising prowess, hauling $44 million recently, which forces Clinton to take time away from the trail to raise money.\\n\\nClinton will attend fundraisers in California over the weekend before heading back to campaign in New York City. After the debate, Sanders boarded a plane to Rome for meetings at the Vatican, and is expected to return Saturday evening.\\n\\nSanders has pledged to stay in the race through to California in June. Asked if he would take the fight all the way to the Philadelphia convention, he said: “I think we're going to win this nomination, to tell you the truth.”\\n\\nThe Clinton campaign, however, believes the momentum, math, and map will be in her favor next week and beyond.\\n\\n“I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday. I'm going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California,” she said. “And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention.”     1\n",
              "Get Ready For A Fight To Replace Scalia\\n\\nSo it's only fitting that news of his death at age 79 ignited an immediate and partisan battle over who might take his place on the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kent., said the vacancy should not be filled until the new president takes office. And Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee, which would oversee any nomination, said it's \"standard practice over the the last 80 years\" for lawmakers to not nominate and confirm such nominees during a presidential election year.\\n\\nBut Democrats are crying foul, pointing out the Senate confirmed Ronald Reagan's nominee Anthony Kennedy by a vote of 97 to 0 in the election year of 1988. (Grassley's staff now says it should have said \"nominated and\" confirmed.)\\n\\nPresident Obama said Saturday evening that, \"I plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in — due time.\"\\n\\nThe top Democrat in the Senate, Harry Reid of Nevada, called on the president to make a nomination \"right away.\"\\n\\n\"Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate's most essential Constitutional responsibilities,\" Reid added.\\n\\nThere are nearly 11 months until a new president takes office, and in the interim, the high court will operate with only eight justices. That means if the jurists tie 4 to 4, the ruling in the lower court would stand, an issue that could have implications for the president's immigration and environmental initiatives; the availability of abortions; voting rights and redistricting; and affirmative action in higher education.\\n\\n\"The American people deserve to have a fully functioning Supreme Court,\" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. \"It is only February.\"\\n\\nThe Senate had been scheduled to take frequent breaks for much of 2016, working in home districts and preparing for the forthcoming elections. But the sudden death of Justice Scalia, and the vacancy it creates, could put pressure on lawmakers to spend more time at work, in Washington. To win confirmation, a Supreme Court nominee effectively needs 60 votes. The newest member of the bench, Elena Kagan, was confirmed with just five Republican votes in 2010, and a few of those lawmakers have since left Congress.\\n\\nPresident Obama has already named two justices to the court, Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. In an interview with the New Yorker magazine two years ago, he stressed his emphasis on diversifying the ranks of the federal judiciary by appointing more women and minorities.\\n\\nA report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said only 36 high-court nominees have been rejected between 1789 and 2010. Eleven were voted down outright, and the remainder were either withdrawn or tabled or otherwise never received Senate votes.\\n\\nThe most recent happened in 1987, when lawmakers nixed the nomination of Robert Bork by a vote of 58 to 42.\\n\\nThere's no deadline or timetable for considering a Supreme Court nomination. CRS said Kagan waited 87 days between her nomination and a final vote. Justice Clarence Thomas waited 99 days after his nomination by President George H.W. Bush. And Bork 's nomination took 108 days.

              "Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => \\nI was born on July 20, 1944, the day of the failed officers’ plot against Adolf Hitler. That means I preceded the official dawning of the nuclear age by exactly 369 days, which makes me part of the last generation to do so. I’m speaking not of the obliteration of two Japanese cities by America’s new “wonder weapon” on August 6th and 9th, 1945, but of the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexican desert near Alamogordo on July 16th of that year. When physicist Robert Oppenheimer , the “father of the atomic bomb,” witnessed that explosion, the line from the Hindu holy book, the Bhagavad Gita , that famously came into his head was: “I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” \\nHow apt it still remains more than seven decades later, at a moment when nine countries possess such weapons — more than 15,000 of them — in their arsenals, most of which are now staggeringly more destructive than that first devastating bomb, and as TomDispatch regular Michael Klare points out today, some of which are closer to possible use than at any point in at least a couple of decades. For those of us who lived through the years of bomb shelters, atomic movie monsters , the Cuban Missile Crisis (which left me, age 18, fearing I might be toast in the morning), the rise and fall of antinuclear movements, and nuclear nightmares of a sort I still remember vividly from my youth in a way I no longer recall the dreams of last night, it’s a horror to imagine that nuclear war is still with us; even more so, because, in Election 2016, we have a presidential candidate who is not only ignorant about those weapons in hard-to-believe ways, but who wonders why “we can’t use them,” and who might months from now have his finger on that “nuclear button” (or rather command of the nuclear codes that could launch such a war). Don’t tell me that this isn’t a living nightmare of the first order. \\nI find it eerie in the extreme and unnervingly apt that the Clinton campaign has brought back a living icon of our nuclear fears, the little girl from the 1964 election who appeared in the famous (or infamous) “ Daisy ” ad President Lyndon Johnson ran against Republican contender Barry Goldwater (who, in retrospect, seems like the soul of stability compared with you know whom). She was then seen counting to 10 as she plucked petals off a daisy just before an ominous, echoing male voice began the countdown to an atomic explosion that filled the screen. Now, that girl, Monique Luiz , a grown woman, is shown saying , “The fear of nuclear war we had as children, I never thought our children would ever have to deal with that again. And to see that coming forward in this election is really scary.” \\nShe’s now 55 years old and, however the Clinton campaign may be using her, there’s still something deeply unnerving for those of us who had hoped to outlast the nuclear age simply to see her there more than five decades later. And if you think that’s unnerving on the eve of the most bizarre presidential election in memory, then read today’s piece by Michael Klare and imagine just how unsettling, in nuclear terms, the years ahead may prove to be.

Each candidate embraced the most self-serving Empire State clich\\u00e9 they could glom \\u2014 Bernie Sanders trumpeted his Spaldeen-stoopball 1950s Brooklyn upbringing (while eliding the endemic segregation in his fiercely divided neighborhood), Hillary touted her 2000 upstate listening tour (downplaying her coziness with Wall Street), while actual Americans Ted Cruz and John Kasich seemed mesmerized by the wild exoticism of half-sour pickles and matzas.\\n\\nOnly Donald Trump \\u2014 a \\u201cBonfire of the Vanities\\u201d character who has busted out of his tabloid 1980s cage to devour 2016 basic-cable America \\u2014 seemed to really get what New Yorkers wanted. Which was to be momentarily amused, then left the hell alone. By necessity (no riots, please!) and instinct (he has Jeter-esque name recognition already) the Donald lay lower than in any previous contest and triumphed resoundingly.\\n\\nIt was semi-fun while it lasted. Here are five takeaways from the New York primary.\\n\\n1. \\u201cMomentum\\u201d is for losers. Bernie Sanders cruised into New York riding a wave of victories: He won eight out of the past nine nominating contests. Which all added up to not very much \\u2014 he cut Clinton\\u2019s lead in pledged delegates from about 240 to under 200. The Sanders campaign \\u2014 taking a page from Clinton\\u2019s own effort in 2008 \\u2014 has been pushing the idea that the Vermont senator was surging past the mathematical impediments to his nomination.\\n\\nClinton nearly erased that run with one big win in New York, a victory that her staff expected to net her about 20 to 25 pledged delegates. It also robbed Sanders of a core (if flawed) rationale for his candidacy: That Clinton couldn\\u2019t win consistently in big, Northern states \\u2014 she can add New York to a column of wins that includes Florida, Texas, Virginia and Ohio.\\n\\nAnd late in the day came news that electrified Clinton\\u2019s already-jazzed staff: that Sanders had unexpectedly flown back to Vermont to recharge his political batteries.\\n\\n2. Trump: The mouth that didn\\u2019t roar. Turns out that shutting up, lying low and reorganizing your amateurish campaign ain\\u2019t such a bad idea. Trump, who kicked off his candidacy at Trump Tower on Fifth took the Fifth during his home-state primary \\u2014 steering clear of perilously liberal Manhattan to hold rallies in Patchogue on Long Island and Rochester upstate.\\n\\nIt may be too late to showcase restraint, but Trump (who attempted rapprochement with Megyn Kelly during the primary sprint) used his dead-certain win here as cover to reset his campaign \\u2014 layering over bar-bouncer campaign manager Corey Lewandowski with seasoned GOP pro Paul Manafort and flack Hope Hicks with former Scott Walker aide Rick Wiley.\\n\\n3. Bernie and Hillary officially hate each other\\u2019s guts. Here was a hometown contest destined to sow bitterness. Sanders (like so many other Brooklynites) professes to be proud of the moxie and street toughness instilled by the borough of his birth, but his first-ever vote was with his feet \\u2014 and he got out, first to Chicago, then to the braying-Guernsey environs of Burlington. Still, he feels pride of ownership and bragged (in Wyoming) that he would make New York transplant Clinton quake; Clinton, who parked her carpetbag in Chappaqua 15 years ago, wanted to crush his upstart challenge in her Chappaqua backyard \\u2014 and she did.\\n\\nClinton won by a wide margin\\u2014 and there was much eff-you high-fiving in the ballroom of the Sheraton New York. But Sanders\\u2019 defeat (accompanied, as always by the big crowds and even bigger torrent of online donations) was the bitterest one yet and deepened the already yawning fault lines between the Bernie stalwarts and a Clinton team increasingly itchy to see him gone. Not going to happen anytime soon, apparently: The tweet being incredulously digested at a Clinton victory party was an MSNBC report quoting Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver defiantly claiming his candidate would take the fight to the convention floor \\u2014 even if Clinton secured an overwhelming lead among pledged delegates and supers.\\n\\n\\u201cWe kicked his ass tonight,\\u201d a senior Clinton aide told me Tuesday night. \\u201cI hope this convinces Bernie to tone it down. If not, f--- him.\\u201d\\n\\n4. Why is John Kasich still running? Sure, Donald Trump built (or branded himself on) over half of Manhattan. But Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the closest thing to a moderate remaining in the Republican field should have appealed to voters here \\u2014 and he couldn\\u2019t make the sale in critical areas like Nassau County or suburban Buffalo. At 11 p.m. he was clocking in at a modest 25 percent \\u2014 less than half of Trump\\u2019s commanding 60 percent level of victory.\\n\\nKasich stands no chance of catching either Trump or Ted Cruz in the delegate hunt\\u2014 so his core rationale is that he fares far better than either man in a general election match-up against Hillary Clinton. Losing so badly in her home state, however, does little to bolster that case \\u2014 and the trickle of cash coming to his campaign is likely to dry up as he heads into the homestretch.\\n\\n5. Whiteout. Clinton managed to fight Sanders to a virtual draw among white voters statewide (and won 60-to-40 among whites in the five boroughs) \\u2014 but the big story, for the umpteenth time in 2016 was Sanders\\u2019 inability to make significant inroads with black voters. Spike Lee made a nice ad for the Vermont senator \\u2014 but it couldn\\u2019t compensate for the candidate\\u2019s repeated (and inexplicable) dismissal of Clinton\\u2019s huge wins in the \\u201cDeep South\\u201d \\u2014 which blacks interpreted as a slight.\",\n          \"in: General Health , Organic Market Classifieds , Organics This vegan custard recipe was inspired by the Cambodian recipe for sangkya , also known as songkya . Traditional sangkya is an eggy custard with a strong coconut flavor. Most recipes call for quite a bit of sugar, so this recipe is a loosely adapted interpretation of the original. It\\u2019s much healthier, completely vegan, and is a great alternative to flour-based holiday treats. This seasonal dessert does need to chill for several hours before serving, so plan ahead. The coconut yogurt and soaked cashew base are held together with coconut, garbanzo, and chia seed flour. The sweetness of the maple syrup is balanced with lemon zest and juice. You can adjust the amount of lemon, or add more coconut flakes if you want a less tart or more coconutty flavor. Kabocha, or Japanese pumpkin, is the best choice for this recipe. Similar to butternut squash, the kabocha has fewer calories and many people say it tastes better. It\\u2019s a great source of beta-carotene, iron, vitamin C , and fiber. You can substitute pie pumpkins if you have trouble finding kabocha. When selecting your kabocha squash, choose a squat, wide shape over a taller, round one. This will give the top of the custard a better chance to brown while baking. You can also skip the pumpkin entirely if you\\u2019re just looking for a vegan baked custard recipe. If you choose this route, make sure to bake the custard for only twenty minutes. One item to note\\u2026 This recipe makes enough custard to fill a pumpkin with a 25 in. (63 cm) circumference. If you\\u2019re using a smaller pumpkin, you may want to halve this recipe. I recommend keeping a small (5\\u201d) springform pan ready for any leftover custard. Just bake it along with your pumpkin for twenty minutes and allow to cool. How Did Pumpkins Get to Japan? If you thought pumpkin and squash came from the Americas, you are absolutely correct. Portuguese traders and explorers originally brought squash and pumpkins from Brazil to Japan in the 16th century [ 1 ] while the Portuguese Empire was expanding into South Asia. The kabocha squash is simply a variety of Cucurbita maxima \\u2014the same species that produces the gigantic pumpkins that win ribbons at state fairs. I don\\u2019t recommend you try to make this recipe with one of those monsters, though. It could feed an army, but the cooking time would take days! Their smaller Japanese cousins, however, do quite nicely. In Japan, the squash is called Kuri Kabocha , or \\u201cnutty pumpkin\\u201d. [ 2 ] If you\\u2019ve ever tasted kabocha you\\u2019ll understand the \\u201cnutty\\u201d moniker. The texture is fluffy and reminiscent of chestnuts, but the flavor is sweet, like a butternut squash crossed with a sweet potato. Kabocha squash have dark, forest-green skin, a slightly squished or flattened shape, and brilliant orange flesh. [ 3 ] You can actually leave your kabocha out as a decoration if you\\u2019re going to use them within a few days. Otherwise, store them in a dark, cool area for up to a month. [ 4 ] Vegan Custard Stuffed Pumpkin Recipe Pre-prep: soak the cashews in lukewarm water for 2-4 hours Prep time: 20 minutes to hollow the pumpkin and prepare the filling Bake time: 45 minutes at 400\\u00b0F (250\\u00b0 C) Chill time: 3-4 hours or overnight Servings: 10 Sharp spoon to hollow out pumpkin Citrus reamer (optional) Food processor or powerful blender Silicone baking mat or parchment paper Baking sheet 1 medium organic kabocha squash (about 25\\u201d in circumference) 2 cups raw cashews, soaked and strained 2 cups organic vanilla coconut vegan yogurt (try our vegan yogurt recipe , just add 1 tbsp maple syrup and 1 tsp vanilla) 2 tbsp organic coconut flour 1 tbsp organic chia seed flour 1 tbsp organic garbanzo bean flour \\u2154 cup organic maple syrup Zest and juice of 2 large organic lemons (about 5 tbsp) 3 tsp pure, organic vanilla extract \\u00bd cup organic coconut flakes, plus extra (optional) 1 tsp Himalayan crystal salt Instructions Start by preparing the custard. Drain excess water from the soaked cashews. Add cashews, yogurt, coconut flour, chia seed flour, garbanzo bean flour, vanilla extract, and Himalayan crystal salt to the food processor and pulse until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add half the maple syrup and lemon juice and pulse for 15 seconds to combine. Taste custard to determine how much of the remaining maple syrup, lemon juice, and coconut flakes to add. Continue pulsing to mix ingredients. Once the taste suits your preference, allow the custard to remain in the food processor while you carve the squash. Preheat oven to 400\\u00b0F. Use a serrated knife to cut the crown off the squash. Start a cut a couple inches from the woody stem of the squash. Continue to cut in a circle around the stem. Pull the crown off the squash and set aside. With a sharp spoon, thoroughly remove the seeds and sinew from the inside the pumpkin and discard. Using a spatula, slowly pour the custard into the pumpkin. Do not overfill. Leave enough room to replace the crown. The custard will rise slightly as it cooks and it will need this space to expand. You can either discard the crown or bake it alongside the custard. Add any remaining custard to the springform pan and smooth flat with a spatula. Line a cookie sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Place the filled squash, crown, and springform pan on the cookie sheet and place in the oven. If baking the crown, set it next to the squash for baking. Do not put it back on top yet. After twenty minutes, remove the springform pan and place on the counter to cool. You can eat this mini custard while you\\u2019re waiting for the main attraction to chill in the fridge. After the squash has been cooking for 40 minutes, check its status. Using the tip of a small knife or fork, poke a small hole in the squash. If it easily cuts into the flesh, congrats! It\\u2019s done! If the squash isn\\u2019t soft enough, bake at 400\\u00b0F for another 15 minutes. Let the squash cool on the counter for about ten minutes, then transfer to a plate or large glass bowl to chill in the fridge. If you baked the crown you can put it back on the squash. Chill the custard for at least 3 hours before serving. Use a sharp serrated knife to cut thin slices. Enjoy! The Difference Between Squash and Pumpkin Because their genetic history is intertwined, squash , pumpkin , and gourd are often used interchangeably. [ 5 ] As a general rule, you carve pumpkins, cook squash, and decorate with gourds. [ 6 ] If you let that sink in, you might wonder how it is that we have so many pumpkin-imbued treats every fall. Well, the truth is, our traditional \\u201cpumpkin\\u201d pies and other tasty dishes are actually made with squash. [ 7 ] Pumpkin ice cream, pumpkin lattes, pumpkin cookies, even canned pumpkin actually contain squash. Don\\u2019t despair, it\\u2019s just a quirk of taxonomy. Autumnal pumpkin delicacies are usually made using winter squash that resembles carving pumpkins, they\\u2019re just not officially classified as pumpkins. Proper pumpkins aren\\u2019t eaten because they\\u2019re watery, stringy, and don\\u2019t taste that good. Winter squash is smaller, softer, and sweeter than its pumpkin cousin. If you feel lost and confused, don\\u2019t worry\\u2014even the FDA has trouble deciding whether or not you\\u2019re eating a pumpkin or a squash.

Web. 17 Oct. 2016.\",\n          \"by Yves Smith \\nBy Silvia Merler, an Affiliate Fellow at Bruegel who formerly worked as Economic Analyst in DG Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission. Originally published at Bruegel Tim Duy \\u2019s Fed Watch says that, as expected, the Federal Reserve left policy unchanged this month and the statement itself was largely unchanged as well. The near term inflation outlook improved from September to November, and with the year-over-year impacts of oil prices falling out of the data, headline inflation will track back upwards, which is not a big surprise. With regards to the timing of the next move, Duy argues that the language suggests conditions are moving in the right direction, but the Fed is still waiting for some \\u201cfurther\\u201d evidence. A continuation of recent trends will likely be sufficient as the \\u201cfurther\\u201d evidence needed to justify a rate hike in December. Would a Trump victory derail a hike in December? Duy does not think this is likely at this juncture, and we should rather be focusing on the labour market. A slowdown in hiring to something closer to 100k a month would probably end the downward pressure on the unemployment rate and raise questions about the Fed\\u2019s basic forecast that the unemployment rate will continue to decline in the absence of additional rate hikes. We get two employment reports before the December meeting. For the Fed to stay on the sidelines yet again, we probably need to see both reports come in weak. The bottom line is that the Fed is looking past the election to the December meeting for its second move in this rate hike cycle and probably it would take some unlikely softer numbers to hold them back again. Greg Ip , on the other hand, writes in The Wall Street Journal that Tuesday\\u2019s election matters. Typically, the Fed is guided by the economic data and elections are just transitory nuisances with little significance for the outlook. But this is no typical election, as one of the candidates represents a dramatic break with economic orthodoxy \\u2013 with promises of protectionism and tax cuts but few details. Trump\\u2019s election would dramatically raise uncertainty, which is the reason why the stock market has tended to go down when his odds of winning go up. For the Fed, lower stock prices translate into less wealth, which is negative for the outlook in its own right. Additionally, the Fed will assume that uncertainty in the rest of the economy will mirror what happens in the markets. All of this reduces the odds it would actually raise interest rates in December. Ip argues that the Fed can take politics into consideration without being motivated by politics: when political decisions can potentially change the course of the economy, the Fed has to incorporate that into its decisions. Thus, a Trump victory would probably cast enough of a pall over the outlook to give the Fed reason to delay its next rate increase into next year. Ironically, Mr Trump may discover that he, not Mr Obama, is the reason the Fed hasn\\u2019t tightened. Richard Clarida , commenting the FOMC statement over at PIMCO\\u2019s blog, says that there was little expectation that the Fed would announce a hike in November. The committee members said nothing in their public remarks since the September meeting to suggest that a rate hike was under serious consideration this week. Indeed, the odds of a November hike as priced by the fed funds futures market were only 16%, and for at least the past 20 years the Fed has never moved when the market has priced less than a 50% chance of a move. As for the balance of risks, the language remained in the statement after making its first appearance this year in the September Fed statement. This is relevant because it would be difficult for the Fed to justify a hike if it believed that risks were tilted to the downside, or if the outlook were so uncertain it could not even characterise the risks. Clarida does not think that the Fed is trying to signal that the odds for a December hike have diminished. A year ago, the Fed wanted to boost market odds of a hike when it thought those odds were too low. Going into today \\u2013 with those odds at 70% \\u2013 the Fed appeared to be content to make minimal changes to the statement only six days before the US election. Whereas in September 2016 three FOMC members dissented, at this month\\u2019s meeting dissenters were only two. So this Fed statement seems aimed at making as few waves as possible: it is a placeholder until the Fed next meets and a rate hike in December continues to be likely, if not a done deal. Natixis\\u2019 Philippe Waechter argues that the Fed is ready for December, under the assumption that Clinton wins the election. He argues that the language on inflation is the only noticeable change in the language of this statement as compared to the previous one \\u2013 together with the remarks on consumption that appears less strong than in September. The Fed wants to recover room for manoeuver in its monetary policy and this is the reason why it is by now ready to accept an increase in the rates. Nevertheless, it is also acting in a context where it needs to signal that it remains vigilant. In an asymmetric approach to monetary policy, the Fed prefers to act too late (at the risk of inflation) than too early (at the risk of a slowdown in economic activity). Tiffany Wilding , again on PIMCO\\u2019s blog, looks at one indicator on which Fed\\u2019s officials have recently trained a lens: the labour force participation rate. The participation rate has risen 0.5 percentage point over the past year, and the rise has occurred despite demographic and other secular trends implying that it should have declined about 0.3 ppt. During the news conference following the Federal Reserve\\u2019s September meeting, chair Yellen highlighted this development as a reason to believe there is more slack in the labour market than previously thought. Wilding argues that the rise is not primarily the result of previously discouraged workers reentering the labour force, but stems largely from a decline in the number of long-term unemployed individuals (25 to 54-year-olds) dropping out. Notably, the decline comes on the heels of a very elevated pace of dropouts in 2014 and 2015, suggesting only limited scope for additional improvement. On the surface, it\\u2019s a good sign that people are now looking for a job longer. However, the CPS data suggest the number of marginally attached and underemployed individuals as a percentage of the working-age population hasn\\u2019t declined significantly since the participation rate started to increase last year. Taken together, these developments could indicate declining and more limited labor market slack. With respect to the participation rate, Wilding believes that the demographic and other secular forces which have driven trend declines in the participation rate will likely take over again. She views participation rate trends as a downside risk to the case for two to three hikes in the federal funds rate by the end of 2017. Meanwhile, Kenneth Rogoff says markets nowadays are fixated on how high the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the next 12 months. This is dangerously shortsighted: the real concern ought to be how far it could cut rates in the next deep recession. Given that the Fed may struggle just to get its base interest rate up to 2% over the coming year, there will be very little room to cut if a recession hits. The two best ideas for dealing with the zero bound (negative rates and higher inflation target) are off-limits for the moment. Of course, there is always fiscal policy to provide economic stimulus. But it is extremely undesirable for government spending to have to be as volatile as it would be if it had to cover for the ineffectiveness of monetary policy. There may not be enough time before the next deep recession to lay the groundwork for effective negative-interest-rate policy or to phase in a higher inflation target. But that is no excuse for not starting to look hard at these options, especially if the alternatives are likely to be far more problematic. The Economist\\u2019s Free Exchange argues that not every argument for keeping interest rates low is a good one. Central bankers may be too keen to spot inflation in the data, but if monetary policy operates with a lag, it makes sense to raise rates before you hit the target, to prevent overshoot. When doves reject this logic, they are implicitly criticising the Fed\\u2019s 2% inflation target, not its strategy for achieving its goal. Inflation targets do not call for making up for past mistakes, and central banks should try to do what they say they are trying to do. This also means that in an equal and opposite situation where the Fed must bring inflation down after an upward shock, it should loosen policy while inflation still exceeds 2%. It is easy to dismiss these points as academic, given that inflation has been below target for too long. At present, the biggest threat to central bank credibility is clearly on the downside. But when doves deny the logic of changing policy in advance of achieving the inflation target, they overreach. The data show plenty to be dovish about: doves should simply point that out and, if they want a price level target, say as much. 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"REAL\",\n          \"FAKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Nothing has been found.\\u201d \\nResearchers will repeatedly scan the star for eight hours per night over the next two months to examine its extremely unusually dimming behavior. The star randomly dims by as much as 22 percent of its output at extremely irregular intervals. This is consistent with large orbiting masses, much larger than planets, blocking out some of the star\\u2019s light when they pass in front of it. All the natural forms of large masses which could cause KIC 8462852\\u2019s dimming aren\\u2019t consistent with the star\\u2019s age . \\nScientists found the first possible evidence of this extraterrestrial civilization around KIC 8462852 last October , when astronomers with Yale University and other top schools published a study that used NASA\\u2019s Kepler Space Telescope. \\nSo far, astronomers haven\\u2019t found a single naturalistic explanation for the star\\u2019s exceedingly unusual dimming, which explains the extremely unusual behavior of the star. Astronomers have examined 500 other stars in the vicinity of KIC 8462852, and seen nothing else like it. \\nThe dense formations near KIC 8462852 are similar to \\u201cDyson Spheres,\\u201d hypothetical, are energy-harvesting \\u201cmegastuctures\\u201d theoretical aliens could hypothetically build by rearranging the solar system. Scientists have pondered the existence of Dyson Spheres since the 1960s, thinking they could be a potential solution to energy problems faced by an extremely old civilization. SETI scientists have long argued humans could detect distant alien civilizations by looking for technological artifacts like Dyson Spheres orbiting other stars. \\n\\u201cWe spent a long time trying to convince ourselves this wasn\\u2019t real. We just weren\\u2019t able to,\\u201d Ben Montet, a Caltech astronomer who co-authored research on the star, told Gizmodo . \\u201cNone of the considered phenomena can alone explain the observations.\\u201d \\nThe best naturalistic explanation favored by astronomers, involves a huge mass of comets erratically orbiting the star and creating enough dust to dim the light, but a January analysis of the star\\u2019s history renders that hypothesis implausible, since the unprecedented dimming has continued for over a century. In order to dim for such a long time period, the star would need to have millions of times more dust and comets orbiting it than is the case. \\nAstronomers estimate that the dimming would require roughly 648,000 giant comets of 200 kilometers in diameter, all aligned to pass in front of the star. The chances of such a formation render it essentially impossible, and there is currently no remotely plausible scientific explanation for what is going on with KIC 8462852. \\nAstronomers have previously frequently misjudge abnormal stellar occurrences and, usually, the abnormalities are simply a new phenomenon. \\nA graduate student in astronomy, found an usual pulsing radio signal so predictable it seemed to be a sign of intelligent life in 1967. The astronomers even nicknamed the signal LGM-1, for \\u201clittle green men,\\u201d and believed they had detected a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization , but it turned out to be the first pulsar.\",\n          \"WikiLeaks Documents Reveal United Nations Interest In UFOs 11/02/2016 \\nHUFFINGTON POST \\nRevelations in a set of hacked emails released by WikiLeaks earlier this month have sparked new conversations about UFOs and speculation that extraterrestrials have been visiting Earth. But a very significant \\u2015 and possibly overlooked \\u2015 group of WikiLeaks items relevant to the topic was released on May 18, 2015. \\nWikiLeaks posted more than half a million U.S. State Department diplomatic documents from 1978 detailing America\\u2019s interactions with countries all around the world \\u2015 including Grenada Prime Minister Eric Gairy\\u2019s efforts to organize a United Nations-based committee to research and investigate global UFO reports. \\nMany of the documents, written by American UN officials, indicated how closely they were monitoring Grenada\\u2019s UFO-related activities. \\nOne document , from Nov. 18, 1978, revealed my involvement in helping Grenada to produce a credible UFO presentation. \\nI had an opportunity in early 1978 to meet Gairy in New York to present an idea about how I thought the UN would pay attention to his UFO crusade. Through his ambassadors, I gave him a copy of a documentary record album, \\u201cUFOs: The Credibility Factor,\\u201d that I produced for CBS Inc. in 1975. \\nGairy and I met, and after I convinced him I could bring a very credible group of speakers to the UN, he agreed to sponsor my proposal (see image below). Shortly after a handshake deal, he made me a temporary delegate-adviser of Grenada and the rest was, well, history. COURTESY OF LEE SPEIGEL This 1978 letter from Grenada to Lee Speigel confirmed that country\\u2019s commitment to sponsor Speigel\\u2019s UFO presentation at the United Nations. \\nThe following image shows part of the group I brought together in July 1978 to meet with UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. He wanted to know what we were planning to do at our November event in front of the Special Political Committee, which included representatives from the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. COURTESY OF LEE SPEIGEL On July 14, 1978, producer Lee Speigel (now a Huffington Post writer) brought together a group of military, scientific and psychological experts to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim to discuss Speigel\\u2019s upcoming presentation to the U.N. Special Political Committee later that year. Topic: The importance of establishing an international UFO committee. Pictured from left: USAF astronaut Col. Gordon Cooper, astronomer Jacques Vallee, astronomer/astrophysicist Claude Poher, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, Grenada Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy, Waldheim, Morton Gleisner of the Special Political Committee, Lee Speigel, researcher Leonard Stringfield and University of Colorado psychologist David Saunders. \\nAnother cable posted on WikiLeaks , from Nov. 24, 1978, refers to Ambassador Richard Petree\\u2019s meeting with Grenada representatives \\u201cto discuss their UFO resolution. Ambassador Petree acknowledged the high level of interest in UFOs among some elements of the private sector and scientific community \\u2026 and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the U.S. and other countries.\\u201d \\nOn Nov. 28, 1978, the day after our presentation at the UN, this document was sent through official channels, detailing the actual UFO event, describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations. \\nA few days after that, on Dec. 2, 1978, a follow-up cable was transmitted, including the following: \\nSubsequent to the introduction of the Grenadian UFO resolution, Misoff [Mission Officer] has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions, which included representation from Austria, USSR and Grenada, in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem. \\nA draft decision to be taken by the Special Political Committee (SPC) has been agreed upon by the participants in the informal negotiations, subject to concurrence of their respective capitals. We think referral of the [UFO] matter to the Outer Space Committee (OSC) without a preordained mandate as to what action is to be taken, provides the flexibility the OSC needs to take whatever action it deems appropriate. \\nIt will also obviate the need to vote on a resolution (and gamble on the results). \\nThe following week brought forth another document , on Dec. 8, 1978, which stated: \\n\\u201cThe General Assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life, including unidentified flying objects, and to inform the secretary-general of the observations, research and evaluation of such activities.\\u201d \\nIt was further suggested that Grenada\\u2019s views on UFOs could be discussed in 1979. Unfortunately, that didn\\u2019t come to pass, as Grenada Prime Minister Gairy was overthrown in a 1979 coup. \\nNeedless to say, without the Gairy-based initiative on UFOs, it was quietly relegated to Grenada\\u2019s back burner. \\nThis is the tip of the UFO-UN iceberg. It shows how the subject of UFOs wasn\\u2019t merely officially ridiculed or slapped aside. There was, and perhaps still is, some interest there, just waiting to emerge.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"REAL\",\n          \"FAKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
